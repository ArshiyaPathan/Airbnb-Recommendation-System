346241,2268950,41230620,2015-08-05,9603753,Angel,If you love coffee like I do you have to appreciate it when a host takes the time to leave a list of the best coffee shops in the area It's little touches like this that the make a huge difference Adon was an excellent host with great communication and follow up The fact his place has an unobstructed view of the Empire State Building and one of the most fabulous roof decks I've had access to in Manhattan makes it a great place to stay in Murray Hill The doormen at his building were super helpful and friendly And my wife loved Tracy the clownfish in Adon's aquarium Would definitely stay there again,3
437666,5334478,51920775,2015-10-25,43300105,Sean,Pictures and description of the apartment were a perfect representation of the place  The location was fantastic really close to the th street subway which allows you to get to pretty much anywhere in Manhattan within  minutes   You could also just walk a lot since it is very central      Apt has working TV and Apple TV hooked up  Small kitchen but doesn't matter much since there are great restaurants   Key exchange and contacting hosts was really easy,4

48446,19084262,160799987,2017-06-15,1512053,Soraya,Danica's place was very clean cozy and beautifully designed Exactly as pictured and there was a great deal of closet and drawer space with loads of hangers It is pleasant comfortable nicely decorated immaculately clean and right away gives the feeling that you are welcome Fantastic location and very comfortable apartment in a great neighborhood There are shops and eateries all around The location is very convenient to several subway lines An extremely valuable feature for a New York apartment - it is quiet despite the neighborhood that is full of life The bedroom is so quiet that it makes you forget that you are in Manhattan Although we were familiar with this part of the city the opportunity to step out at night into the bustling whirlwind of life - and the chance to have some rest after that - made us remember that life is to be enjoyed Danica herself was an amazing person She’s very lovely and was very easy to communicate with and very accommodating I recommend it wholeheartedly,4

258815,7202368,100521282,2016-09-09,13656473,Nicole,We stayed in the apartment for  nights The building and the apartment itself are absolutely authentic We loved being a part of New York for that time at least we felt a bit as if living in New York It is different as if you stay in a hotel in Manhattan The neighborhood was relatively quiet at night of course it is not comparable to a neighborhood in a small town There are always noises in the old building or outside on the street that are new to oneself The bathroom is small but was equipped with some stuff like sunscreen shower gel etc Towels and bed sheets were provided by Jason The sink was very small too small for us to brush our teeth Also there is a lack of receptacles in the bathroom I prefer to dry my hair in the bathroom to avoid flying loose hair around in the house Well one have to keep in mind that it is an old building There is also a small kitchen equipped with all necessary stuff to cook a meal or prepare breakfast Everything was very clean and ready to use We can recommend the bakery named Saraginha Bakery nearby they offer fresh bread good coffee and other things The service is very friendly There are also other cafes and deli's around The walk to the nearest subway station Utica is about - minutes (go left when you exit the building and just straight ahead) We definitely felt foreign at the beginning but get more and more used to the neighborhood after a few days and finally felt safe Getting into Manhattan by subway is about  minutes with the blue line A or C In the evening we often took the express lines back to Utica and were back in the apartment very quickly All in all I can recommend Jason's apartment Jason is a great host answered questions immediately His welcome was fabulous despite we never met him ,4

165925,1231519,123474169,2016-12-29,9410851,Allison,Let me start off by staying that the apartment is nice and the initial communication with Sam (Andrew's brother) was great I was under the impression that this was going to be a quiet stay which was not the case The hosts were up till very late hours in themorning and with paper thin walls- staying up until am talking loudly & walking with shoes on while guests were there was very inconsiderate I got a pretty horrible night sleep as the host was up again around am We will not be staying here againThe room is comfortable for what it is but the pillows were very thin and uncomfortable I'm sure staying here would be fine for another guest as long as the hosts are more considerate of guests as they advertise it as a quite place to stay ,5

295883,253806,67468609,2016-03-29,1009854,Nancy,Very comfortable clean and nicely decorated hotel and units that honour the history of the building as a box making factory The Greenpoint neighbourhood is full of great small restaurants and shops is very walkable and usually feels safe Good access to the subway and a short cab ride into Manhattan or Williamsburg Staff is friendly and approachable Rooms only get serviced one every three days but are very clean and fresh towels are provided each day The one drawback currently is the construction on the street which was noisy during the day Also the sound barrier between rooms is not very good But if you want to get away from the craziness of Manhattan the Box offers a retreat experience in a charming historic neighbourhood at the end of a busy day,5

636082,42580,16925491,2014-08-04,3482342,Gary,Most of my criticism of the property is due to my failure to carefully read the advertisement  My wife doesn't like to share a bathroom and it was on a different floor no less  In addition I believe the owner slept on the downstairs sofa which we had to pass to get to the bathroom off the kitchen area  (I'm also thankful that I and not my wife was in the bathroom when a multi-footed bug decided to pass through )  The bedroom itself while clean was poorly finished  Carpentering repairs were unfinished the paint was haphazardly applied and the door knob was insecure  In the main although neither my wife nor I are stuffed shirts (we've enjoyed rooms in Paris and San Francisco through AirBnB)  I think this room and the living arrangements in the house are better suited to a younger more Bohemian lifestyle where privacy and attention to detail may be less important,5

339206,1564553,70861965,2016-04-21,10551623,Milca,Pasé una semana muy linda en el departamento de Madeleine Está muy bien ubicado a pocas cuadras del subte y en una zona segura con gente y muchos lugares para comer y comprar cosas Está en el medio de Chinatown y Little Italy y a pocas cuadras del Soho galerías de arte el New Museum y demás barrios a los que se puede llegar a pie Me encantó hablar con ella es muy simpática y cuidó que tuviera todo para que esté cómoda (incluso me dejó unas manzanas y barras de cereal) Los gatitos son adorables y mimosos ya los extraño Viajé sola (y era la primera vez que alquilaba habitación en departamento a través de airbnb) y no tuve ningún problema para moverme en la ciudad y siempre que le pregunté cosas a través de la página o en su casa fue muy amable y me respondió muy rápido e incluso me recomendó excelentes lugares para comer o tomar algo (amé Wild ginger) La habitación es exacta como aparece en las fotos Nunca tuve frío e internet anda perfecto El departamento es súper acogedor y limpio (la casa suele oler muy bien aún con los dos gatos) La ducha en la cocina funciona perfecto y no es para nada incómoda (en mi caso me parecía algo tan extraño que tenía que ir a este departamento) Volvería a Nueva York y me hospedaría con ella nuevamente sin dudarlo,1
555558,9563873,103101860,2016-09-20,91274726,Jiae,I was a little worried about using airbnb and staying in a house that is not a hotel However it turned out it was a pretty good experience Everything Steve described on his house was accurate It was clean secure and friendly as if I was staying in my friend's houseThe room was quite small as you can see in the picture Steve posted but it didn't bother me at all I could put all of my luggages with no problem ( big ones and a backpack) They had shelves that I can put my makeups and other stuff which was really convenient Even there was a TV in the room which entertained me A LOT during the trip while I was staying in the house at night The bathroom was quite clean and they had everything I needed In the kitchen there were a microwave and a refrigerator and it was really helpful for reducing budget of traveling such an expensive cityThe only downside was location Since I was staying in NYC for about a week I bought the -day pass and it was exclusive for metros and buses It took about an hour or sometimes less to get to Manhattan riding only those It wasn't that bad for me because I thought of it as a part of traveling(watching the view of New York City) however if you don't want to spend your time on going back and forth to the places this house wouldn't be a good fit for you I prefer having a clean bathroom and privacy over anything so it was just a perfect place compare to hostels in the main cityOverall it was such a nice place to stay I really appreciate Steve and his wife taking a good care of my needs,5

281977,9470677,54945828,2015-11-25,44110548,Ravi,Host was warm and met me on time and the neighborhood was great and the place serviceable Clearly a place rented out by a property agent so lacking some of the charm of another type of brownstone but clean and well-maintained The only thing I'd caution a guest about is the cleaning fee which is not readily apparent when you book but that needs to be paid in cash and which in my case nearly doubled the cost of my stay in a manner I didn't find forthright Still host was responsive (except around  PM when I was having trouble with my key but then again I don't expect him to be available then) and left towels bath products clean sheets blanket and wifi so worth staying especially if you are interested in going to the museums or Central Park ,2

754436,8903437,159812342,2017-06-11,125560702,Hayley,This is a large apartment at a fairly decent price for New York City It easily accommodated  adults who came together to visit the city from all over the country it was spacious and offered ample sleeping space The check-in and check-out process was simple Now our story less than two hours after checking in me and my friends tried to leave the apartment to make it to a show we had planned on seeing but the doorknob was limp in the handle No amount of maneuvering would allow us to open the door After calling the cleaning lady who let us in the host and Air BnB we wound up with a faulty door the only true entrance in the whole apartment We were  minutes late to our ticketed event only after leaving through an emergency exit window and one of our friends missed the entire evening as she waiting three hours for help to arrive Had there been an emergency we would have been in trouble but even without one you expect to be able to ENTER and EXIT a rental for which you paid nearly  We never heard from the host during the whole ordeal and still have not heard from her to this day to see if we were okay or to apologize for what happened The cleaning lady eventually found a locksmith but at one point she me I needed to be patient and that help was on the way  minutes later I found out that she had not even reached a locksmith yet We sometimes went - minutes with no updates We were checked on in person at am This would not happen at a hotelAll of this is to say that this is not a luxury apartment and this left a very bad taste in my mouth for Air Bnb rentals The fixtures were poor (ie the doorknob) the furniture does not match the photos in the pictures and is much cheaper than described the paint job is bad and it wasn't totally clean  The apartment is also in Kips Bay - not in Murray Hill or Gramercy This is a great spot if you just need a place to crash with a large party and if your main concern is ease of getting around but it's not as glamorous as the price tag would suggest,4

532833,1001147,52672319,2015-11-01,25985573,Adam,Het verblijf was in één woord fantastisch Om te beginnen is de locatie perfect Het ligt precies tussen twee metro haltes in die beide slechte een paar minuten lopen zijn Vanaf deze stations gaat de J-train die je regelrecht binnen  minuten naar het hartje van Manhattan brengt een uitstekende en snelle verbinding Ook bevind er zich om de hoek van de straat een zeer fijne supermarkt en wat restaurantjes waar je prima kan eten voor zeer weinig geld Verder is de buurt prima ook al lijkt het op eerste gezicht wat achterhaalt maar dat heeft juist zijn charme De grote van de kamer is echt heerlijk Je hebt enorm veel ruimte en niet geheel onbelangrijk een heerlijk breed comfortabel bed Ook de kast/werkplek is een top plekje om even wat aan te werken of even te zitten Ook de badkamer is perfect met een heerlijk groot bad en voor de rest allemaal top voorzieningen Kate is ook een super host Zeer attent en aardig Kortom verblijf je alleen of met twee personen in New York en is het voor jou geen probleem om iets wat buiten Manhattan te verblijven dan is dit de perfecte plek Ik heb hier een maand gezeten en elke dag ervan genoten ,1

380442,1511730,39838925,2015-07-26,38088282,Will,Absolutely amazing AirBnB experience - certainly recommend without a doubt Ronni was accommodating to our check-in time explained all the amenities available (A/C three beds one futon kitchen bathroom balcony etc) when we arrived and gave us a run down of all the local shops restaurants bars and hot spots too He promised to be available for all questions during whatever hour and delivered when we inquired about a transportation service to JFK on our last day Ronni was even able to provide us two additional options after the first became unavailable I can't begin to bat home how comforting the hospitality was as Ronni was above and beyond by providing towels toothbrush/toothpaste travel kits and a bottle of wine and wine glassesThe location of Ronni's apt is amazing It's a stone's throw south of Union Square short walk through NYU will bring you to all the shops in SoHo and all the East Village bars and ruckus was also easy to walk to when I ventured to meet some old NYU friends (saved on taxi expenses) My co-workers were able to venture to the High Line and Chelsea Market with ease while convenient subway stations allowed us to travel further north to Midtown and elsewhere Furthermore the convenient Union Square station was clutch during our excursions to Brooklyn too The apt is small and cozy but with four different sleeping accommodations you'll be more than set (  queen bed  futon  queen air beds) The front door downstairs and at the apt never gave us much issue so it was nice to stumble back without fiddling with the locks The balcony was relaxing and private which was nice for us to hang out on during the weekend's great weather We didn't bump into many neighbors but the few that we saw were respectfulI'm a huge fan of changing things up and experiencing things in variety but Ronni made our experience at his AirBnB so great that I'll have very little reason to go elsewhere A experience folks If you're on the fence for any reason don't hesitate to stay with Ronni,5

764190,1294438,11124074,2014-03-22,9947322,John,We recently stayed in Jeremy's LOFT on West nd Street - and this is very much a slice of New York loft living The apartment is an absolute surprise and delight up a flight of stairs from the street level entrance - come in through the door and you enter into a warm and inviting Art Gallery and where you'll more than likely meet your host JeremyThe area that guests share is at the far end of the apartment (through the Gallery) where there is a common kitchen and then the guest area comprising a bedroom and a guests bathroom (with shower over the bath) This area is private from Jeremy's at the opposite end of the apartmentJeremy is so unobtrusive you'll hardly know that he's there and he is the perfect host with suggestions and directions if you would like themWe chose to experience New York Life (breakfast lunch and dinner) so had no need to eat in but the kitchen is more than adequate if you choose to use this to prepare your own mealsThe Apartment is conveniently located and the underground is a short walk away New York Streets work on a very good grid system so if you happen to wander off line slightly it's not too hard to get back to where you want to goThe apartment is clean and presentable - clearly it's not the Carlton Ritz but equally you're not paying Ritz prices either A comparable Hotel of  star rating is going to cost you twice what you'll pay for Jeremy's apartment so it all needs to be put into perspective - the apartment was amazingly quiet at night and it doesn't lack for warmthYou might find the stair access up to the apartment a wee challenge particularly if you've got some heavy suitcases but the walk up the stairs and getting into the apartment is well worth the effortThis was our first experience of an Air BnB apartment and we were pleasantly surprised by the value for money approach Would stay with Jeremy again without hesitation,4

411871,13684012,102583157,2016-09-18,78269302,Patrick,This is a great place to crash if you read the reviews and know what to expect Perfect for a younger crowd The room isn't much other than a mattress to sleep on Lofts are small and you have to be a little nimble to get up the ladder The key point is that the amenities are great including a basement with a couch and Nintendo  emulator stage with keyboard drums and your pick of guitars plenty of couch space and kitchen/dining space an awesome outdoor space with sand bar bbq grill on the patio and chill roommates Reminded me a lot of co-ops in Berkeley Maria and Robin and gracious hosts They threw a huge birthday and house warming party while I was there and it was a blast They have cats in the pictures and mention pets in the description I am allergic but knew that going in Took my allergy pills and didn't have too many issues The space is conveniently close to the Ditmas subway stop on the F train and walking distance from several nice brunch spots Also  block away from a grocery store that is open all the time Overall I would recommend this place highly for folks looking to save a little money by staying further out from the city and a young crowd who is open to this kind of artist and creative type experience,5

396844,169306,2739513,2012-10-28,3558916,Kevin,This was my first Airbnb experience and I have to say that Vanessa's place served Airbnb well  The room was exactly how it looked online  I didn't feel cramped which if you have stayed anywhere in NYC before is a nice departure from the norm  The brownstone is split into different areas so after checking in I never saw another soul my entire stay  Vanessa was very accommodating in granting me a late check in late and a late check out too  Also I noticed on Airbnb that some people in NYC want you to spend your entire day out and about--you're not allowed to be inside during the day I have never found that to be an issue BUT it's nice to have the option of a place to return to whenever you would like to relax and unwind  Vanessa has made no such demands and her place is accommodating to those who want whenever that sanctuary from the city  Only  minutes to downtown on the D or  train (if you aren't from the city that sounds like a long travel time but I promise it's short---it takes  minutes to get to downtown if you live downtown),5

308723,697499,53044146,2015-11-04,39399794,Stephen,My wife and I spent a week at Charlie's apartment on the upper west side  The apartment is a wonderful large studio with a nice compact kitchen and a fine bathroom  It was immaculately clean and has three big windows looking out on a tree-lined quiet street  Even better it is located steps away from Central Park and near many lovely restaurants  Dealing with Charlie was a delight  He was there when we arrived showed us around the apartment and then showed us around the neighborhood  All in all the apartment and Charlie exceeded our expectations,4

483872,3811639,115068780,2016-11-21,98199385,Samuel,Not sure how it is possible Samantha has perfect reviews I've stayed in many air bnbs and I'm not particularly picky but this place was downright dirty and falling apart I think she promotes it as artsy but the place is coated in dust as well as stained/dirty linens no toilet paper terrible bed fixtures in bathroom falling apart no bathroom door and walls that are paper thin The place is located in a building that could be condemned any day with missing dry wall through the the halls and exposed wires and pipes throughout the building Location is also extremely inflated in reviews On a corner that is not trendy and hipster as advertised but instead dangerous and ghetto This is the only bad review I have ever written but I think it I owe it to possible future tenants to know what they are paying for If you want to experience great food which is always one of my goals get a different place The only decent restraint around was the Rookery ,3

476823,5870127,97468146,2016-08-27,87515605,J,Unfortunately our experience was not as we had hopedThe air conditioning is not adequate  and there is no privacy Zero air conditioning in the back bedroomWe arrived to an uninhabitable hot basement apartment that was full of mosquitoes My son had  mosquitoes on his one leg inside  minutes of being there He called the Family over to witness his mosquito leg buffet The garbage left at our door step and was full and smelly The internet did not work initially so we went to a local restaurant to get internet to inform our hosts of the situation They were in EuropeWe then headed to manhattan late at night as the apartement was around  degrees F We arrived back late in the morning to a still hot apt only to be woken up by banging through the floor boards from guests above As we were leaving a cleaning lady wanting access to the above apartment through our apartment The code given to her was for our apt and then another code to use a locked a door and go upstairs She should have had a code solely for the upstairs apt So she came through our apt with us sleeping in our undies trying to stay cool I placed all the other peoples garbage (from our apartment and the upstairs apartment out onto the street) so I pay  and have to take out everyone's garbage The next day we were woken once again by a utility guy who wanted access to the basement through our apartment I said noTerribly hot and no privacyIm sure if Sarah was home the situation would have been different We picked this apt based upon the great reviews It is just unfortunate she was notI have to give an honest review beautiful neighbourhood but our experience was disastrous,4

696732,10823007,80790850,2016-06-19,63988560,Kirsty,I stayed at this apartment for  and a half weeks with two colleagues when we visited New York The apartment is lovely and is as described in this listing It is very conveniently situated close to all major subway lines The only thing that you should note is that the apartment is on the th floor of a building which does not have an elevator We never had any direct contact with the host but the company who handles the hosting were fantastic - they responded promptly to all of my messages and were very accommodating Overall I would highly recommend renting this beautiful apartment,4
85329,10009771,158120884,2017-06-05,66975400,Mark,Eriks place is good for its price The place was  blocks from the subway station which was very nice and convenient The only thing that was bothersome was the cleanliness of both the bathroom and the room itself The blankets and sheets seemed a little dirty and used The floors didn't seem like they have been cleaned in a while The bathtub was pretty filthy and was afraid to be in there barefoot Also there's only one bathroom for  bedrooms so you have to be vigilant in getting in there before anyone else But if you're on a budget and really just need a place to sleep and to store your belongings I guess this place works  If I'm ever in New York again I'll definitely cough up the extra money for a decent hotel ,5

428055,66741,1488023,2012-06-15,774192,Kisha,Stefano's apartment is absolutely lovely and CLEAN Actually it seemed like the garden apartment was newly refurbished and everything seems almost brand new I travel to NYC for business and stayed during the weekday It was only two of us but this would be a great apartment for a small family- there is a twin size bed and a separate bedroom that opens up to the garden as shown in the photos The TV is small but seriously this is a great neighborhood and you have no business being inside For us it was NBA finals it was raining and the apartment was so very comfortable we decided to order in and hang around the apt to watch the game The bed was very comfortable and we had a really great nights rest I personally loved waking up to the birds and looking at the gardenStefano was very friendly helpful and was quick to respond He and his family live upstairs This may pose a problem for people who take day time naps because you can hear them upstairs I don't think there is a lot of insulation between the ceiling and floors BUT this is only a problem during the day and around dinner time At night and early in the morning the family is on the rd floor presumably where the bedrooms are and the place is dead silent  The only other issue is the wifi is spotty because the router is upstairs This was a problem for my partner who was working from the apt but if you are checking email and less data absorbing searching you will be just fine There are tons of restaurants bars- especially if you are a craft beer fan- and the train is nearby I would DEFINITELY stay there again and recommend to friends ,4

313280,69755,19039623,2014-09-05,18126354,Natascha,Andrea hat uns sehr offen und freundlich empfangen Das Zimmer ist sehr klein und eher für eine Einzelperson als für zwei Das Bett ist sehr hart und quietscht bei jeder Bewegung Auch die Aussicht ist nicht sehr schön da man in einen dunklen Innenhof sieht Tageslicht ist rar Das Zimmer erfüllt jedoch vollkommen seine Zwecke Außerdem ist es sauber Die Küche das Badezimmer konnten ohne Probleme mitbenutzt werden Die Gegend ist nicht unbedingt die Beste vor allem wenn man das erste Mal in den USA ist Gangs lungern am Straßenrand und zum Abend sollte man sich nicht unnötig lange draußen aufhalten Frauen die allein unterwegs sind würde ich die Gegend nicht weiterempfehlen Andrea ist Musiker und das hört man auch tagsüber Er ist sehr ruhig und widmet all seine Zeit in die Musik (Klavier&Bass) Die Subway ist fünf Minuten entfernt und es gibt genügend Supermärkte in der Umgebung Fazit Nicht unbedingt für Anfänger und zu Zweit jedoch für jemanden der schon öfter in den USA war und keine hohen Ansprüche hat völlig in Ordnung ,5

377049,8368794,77693862,2016-06-02,15220846,Marika,I would not stay in this apartment again In fact I left a day early because I didn't want to stay there any longer On the positive side Sid allowed my last minute schedule change which was gracious It was dirty - like it hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long - the bathroom smelled like mildew the fridge smelled there were dishes still out and the whole apartment just needed to be cleaned He only left one large bath towel - no hand towel or bathmat or any other towels at all The bed looked slept in and there was no cover on the duvet The apartment buzzer doesn't ring in the apartment so any deliveries or guests need to call you and you go all the way down the  floors to open the door for them There was no cable tv even though the listing said there was and the tv remote didn't work Needless to say I would not recommend staying here at all I feel bad because I've never left a bad review before but I wouldn't want other people booking this place and getting the surprise that I did,4

488256,11618532,108118366,2016-10-14,4872087,Jonathon,Gabriela's apartment is a lovely little space with real charm The neighbourhood is an excellent spot not as hectic as Manhattan or Williamsburg but with everything you need in walking distance (including cafes bars restaurants the subway a great bookstore a supermarket etc) We stayed for a week and I wish we could have stayed longerA couple of things to keep in mind the apartment is on the rd floor and there's no lift the bed isn't huge but it is very soft and the shower doesn't have much pressure But none of these were a serious issue for usI'd certainly recommend a stay here,4

23453,776050,12370940,2014-04-30,1665015,Tiphaine,L'appartement n'est pas bien entretenu les draps les oreillers et la couverture n'étaient pas propres Il n'y avait pas de rideau alors qu'il y a deux fenêtres dans la chambre On a fait comme on a pu pour occulter les deux fenêtres La salle de bain est ancienne la baignoire salle et surtout il y a un tuyau bizarre en bronze qui s'écoule dans la baignoire mais que l'on peut enlever quand on prend sa douche  Vraiment étrange et pas du tout dans les normesLe quartier est bruyant donc prévoyez des boules quiès sachant qu'il y a un métro aérien qui passe très souvent Les familles autour sont désagréables et ne disent même pas bonjour Il faut monter  étages pour arriver à l'appart et les escaliers du bâtiment ne sont pas lavés tous les jours On a même vu un rat juste à côté de la porte d'entrée qui donnait sur la rue On n'est pas resté beaucoup à l'appartement car il y a tellement à voir à New-York mais on était assez déçu et un peu dégoûté du peu d'entretien fait dans cet appartement Le point positif on n'est pas loin à pied du métro F qui dessert beaucoup de lieux intéressants et il y a le bus qui amène au ferry pour embarquer sur Liberty Island par exempleNous n'avons pas vu l'hôte une collègue était là le jour où nous sommes arrivés et elle nous as dit de ne pas laisser la nourriture dehors pour éviter les bêtes on n'a pas voulu savoir quel type de bête il pouvait s'agir mais ça ne nous a pas mis en confiance dès le début On a eu du mal à contacter Alberto pour le rendu des clés et on a fini par laisser les clés dans l'appart Je ne peux pas dire grand chose sur Alberto à part qu'il n'est pas facile à joindreJe ne conseille pas cet appart à moins de n'être vraiment pas regardant au niveau de la propreté de la salle d'eau et de la literie Nous sommes déçus par la qualité de cet appartement et du coup de son rapport qualité/prixSinon New-York vous fera vite oublier ces aspects mais nous ne retournerons pas dans cet appartement si nous retournons à New-York un jour,1

360694,8341556,125402082,2017-01-05,17034386,Justine,I arrived earlier than expected and although Mehmet was working he made sure to do everything he could to provide me the keys and directions to the apartment (AirBnB also gives a slightly different address to his place) The apartment was clean warm and smelled great The bed was very comfortable and the room was large for NYC standards The room has a large TV which is nice to have if you are looking to veg out after a day of exploring Bathroom was clean which is very important to me The location is just a block away from the  train which was ideal for getting around NYC taking only about  minutes to get to Times Square I also felt safe coming home in the evenings The living room was rented out while I stayed here so I felt like I had to adjust my schedule a bit so as to not wake the other guests - BUT this is only because I normally am up ready cooked meals for the day and out of the door by  If you are an average person this will not be an issue as the other guests are told to be up by  or  so as to convert the living room back into an open space Mehmet made sure to check in every day to see how his guests were making out and to offer any help He was very accommodating tentative and communicative I would highly highly recommend staying at his place ) ,5

430219,12366408,182855215,2017-08-15,142913045,Marlon,I think security issues are the most important thing Several people have commented on the gas smell and I confirm it if there is smell it is because there is a gas leak and it can be potentially dangerous for the guest On the other hand in my stay they broke the locks of the main access doors to the building and for two days until I left they were not fixed it is true that they have security cameras but these did not prevent the doors being violatedIf it is true that for the price you do not get something better the host can make some small adjustments to make the stay of your guests more enjoyable,2

747185,7323186,40173039,2015-07-28,10060581,Sonal,I stayed at the residence outlined by Felippe for  nights  The photos are accurate and though cozy has much of what one would need including a bed kitchen and batchroom  It is in an ideal location – at the north end of Hell’s Kitchen and very close to Central Park  From initiating an inquiry with Felippe he was largely communicative and friendly in his manner and tone with me    He was accommodating and thoughtfulUnfortunately we did have a situation that arose that probably marred the visit for both of us  However given that a guest on AirBnb pays money for what is in fact a ‘product’ in the form of a place to stay I should say that the ‘product’ provided – that of a room – was perfectly satisfactory,5

50500,13142326,158417308,2017-06-06,130201593,Dustin,Probably the best place for the price Really close to the subway Bed was comfortable Room was adequate Just beware this place has(I think)  rooms And it seems that they are all airbnb The biggest problem was the bathroom There are  of them with toilet and shower but with so many people in  place you can find yourself waiting to use them Or if you wait too long you might get a cold shower There were a couple days with no toilet paper and even though it says it has an iron( and I did text Sergio about this cuz he was out of the country) one was not provided He did however respond back immediately but the problem wasn't solved   So if you are antisocial or like your privacy you should probably keep looking but if all you need is a place to crash after experiencing all New York and are on a budget and don't mind being around strangers then this is a good place to stay,5

317711,2629613,147577732,2017-04-27,1374526,Catt,It's hard to figure out where to start we loved everything about Rod and Paddington's Chelsea apartment Rod gave us great insights to the neighborhood and beyond while checking us in and he didn't even complain about our delayed flight and thus later than expected check-in We loved the art the light the well equipped kitchen the linens and deliciously comfortable mattress good water pressure in the shower and reliable internet After a couple of drizzly days we adored the working fireplace And there were full length mirrors (that never happens with Airbnbs - what's up with that)There are a lot of terrific locations in NYC but the nearby restaurants and markets (don't miss the Foragery just around the corner) and yes bars and wine shops make for an easy landing in an exceptionally lovely neighborhood Take a quick walk to the Highline and Chelsea Market or to subway stations that'll get you anywhere in the city in a snap It's a lively busy community and Saturday night there was a great show out front in the wee hours but the layout of the apartment meant that the bedroom in the back was still quietThere were only two drawbacks One as in Europe combined washers and dryers are a clever idea that tend to be temperamental and this one is no exception Luckily there are plenty of towels and bed linens so you won't have to wash those and there are easy fluff and fold places around the corner if you need clean clothes Two we finally had to leave and go home We miss Chelsea and this gorgeous apartment already and we're in San Diego If we'd had to go home to Omaha (not that there's anything wrong with that) I'd be truly bereft We'll be back if they'll have us ,4
321170,18250284,185410980,2017-08-21,18111964,Patricia,We loved everything about it The dogs instantly felt at home Spending time with them in the back yard was awesome Coming back to the neighborhood and Central Park brought back great memories But meeting James and Tom was definitely the highlight of the weekend,5
680102,7657879,108340502,2016-10-15,51447248,Jeff,The positive reviews reflect much of our own experience excellent host excellent location (Chelsea Market around the corner) spacious apartment close to subway (blue line around the corner)Customers with disabilities should be made aware that the apartment is not at street level You need to go down three steps If you have access to clothes washing facilities there is a  step stairwell you have to go down Light levels are also an issue because the apartment is lower than street level It remains dark well into the daylight hours so you should set your alarms because you might sleep in a lot There were some issues with the (mostly halogen) ceiling lighting which you may have to keep on through much of the day I suspect the lighting transformers might not be working so well since  some of the lighting arrays would be strong one day and very low the next The two main bedrooms are at the front of the apartment facing the street They are bed width rooms (a little more than twice the length) You cant really open the windows to the bedroom because the disposal bins are next to or near the windows so you have to use the air conditioners (split system in every room) to get airflowIf you are not staying there for more than a week dont forget that you may not have access to the clothes washers and dryers so you need to have enough clothing packedChelsea/Meatpacking is a great location Multicultural a relaxed atmosphere a mixture of people from all social classes and identities In my view it is better than the oversanitised blocks around Central Park Chelsea/ Meatpacking close to lots of places tourists want to go Its a good area for first time visitors to Manhattan When you get to the apartment go round the corner to Chelsea markets for a feed and nice bottle of wine to take home Immediate groceries Walgreens around the corner going east Big food and beverage shopping- I suggest the really excellent Westside Market on th Avenue and th street Bread and pizza square Try Sullivan Street Bakery on th and th or Amys at the Chelsea MarketsNYC first timers you need (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps Subway Map and compass on your smartphone to minimize disorientation when you come out of subways Enjoy Its a great place to be,4

43718,3869779,31578047,2015-05-07,1643830,Kristina,When I arrived unfortunately neither Alex or Mante could meet me at the apartment as planned because Alex had been called into work at the last minute Luckily though his workplace was really central so I could just pop off the subway to meet him and get the keys so I did not have to wait for hours after the eight hour flight which was really niceOther than that I must say that Alex and Mante were very warm and generous hosts They always offered wine and coffee had great tips for thrift stores and coffee shops in the neighborhood and were friendly and easy to talk to The apartment is very charming although somewhat more crowded than the pictures might show When I was there they had just been thriftstoring so the most of the living room area was filled with furniture on its way to their storage unit Still I found it a very homely and cosy space What I do think should be mentioned is that as the room is right outside the kitchen and there is as you might see from the pictures not a full wall so you basically hear everything that happens in the apartment As Alex works as a DJ he plays a lot of music (a lot of faboulous soul and funk) so if you are the type who would prefer a more quite space this might not be ideal But if you are searching for a lively place in a charming neighborhood I could absolutely recommend this place ,4

752809,1159142,6300484,2013-08-07,6382395,Geraldine,We stayed with Keisha for  days and it was a fantastic experience The neighbourhood in east Harlem is nice and safe and we didn't have any problems The apartment is -min walk to the  line or the / line There is a deli and pharmacy downstairs that is good for small groceries and breakfast/lunch and drinksCentral Park is -min walk away )Keisha was a great hostess Before we arrived we corresponded multiple times and although Keisha couldn't be there to meet us she arranged a friend to meet us instead who was great There was a mix-up re dates with air bnb but Keisha was extremely accommodating for us and enabled us to use her room (private master) to honour our bookingThe room was clean tidy lockable and has cupboard space and air conditioning With a clean and neat bathroom (shared)Keisha also provided us with much info re what to do in New York and how to get around including written notes which was very much appreciated as well as being helpful information It was lovely to meet Keisha and we shared many good conversations Overall a great experience and when we are in New York again we will definitely stay with Keisha,5

92883,865033,13063509,2014-05-19,2513313,Kristen,We just arrived home after staying at Brownstone Beauty on the Greene for  days The place is pretty much exactly as it is in the pictures and was clean and for the most part comfortable We really didn't spend much time there except to sleep but it was nice to have the kitchen to prepare breakfast and for coffee in the morning The subway station is within walking distance and there are plenty of corner stores to grab items quickly and grocery stores are within walking distance as well Tee was there to greet us upon arrival and spent some time showing us the place and helping us with any questions we had I was less than crazy about the walk up to the rd floor and the walk to the subway but that is personal preference and not in any way a complaint about the apartment or the hosts If you are used to staying in Manhattan and having close access to your hotel for quick breaks in the day then this place is not for you This was our first time using airbnb and I would definitely book through it again just closer to the city ,5

367960,6967723,148379858,2017-04-30,89136914,Ty,The area reminded me of home I'm from Chicago and I felt like I was walking down one of the blocks in my home town If you're used to more upscale types of neighborhoods then you may be taken aback by the neighborhood It's not where the Huxtables lived However I felt really safe and on the weekend it was still quiet I often came back to the BNB after pm and I felt completely safe walking from the train Also the train ride into Harlem/Manhattan is about - minutes I didn't got to the Bronx so I don't know how long that ride would be The apartment was comfortable think of it as staying at one of your relatives homes Everything was as the description said The only part I hated was walking down into the basement area and that's because I'm afraid of bugs and spiders I was just hoping that none met me at the door LOL This place is budget friendly And if you are there just to sleep while you explore NYC this place is for you ,5

417537,3905849,176758071,2017-07-31,32992529,Camille,Esmond's place was incredibly beautiful From the large windows to the grand piano he delivered a wonderful apartment in the Gramercy Park neighborhood The apartment was indeed wonderful with just a tiny dust and heating issue My roommate has severe asthma and non severe sleep apnea On our first night she didn't sleep She couldn't breath as it was roughly - degrees upstairs She ended up sitting in the kitchen all night as that was the least problematic place for her in the unit After a couple nights of not sleeping for my roommate we decided to purchase an air mattress so she could sleep downstairs and breath comfortably When placing the air mattress we had to move the coffee table over an inch which revealed a massive amount of dust everywhere It was probably one of the worst dust situations I had ever seen This was especially surprising since I was just informed of the recent cleaning However all it took was a few boxes of wipes which I purchased and a broken vacuum that we found in the home to fix the issue Unfortunately and unbeknownst to me I had a roommate who was unaware of the contract I had signed with Esmond and  slipped on a few of Esmond's rules  such as having house guests one night and placing materials on the piano  When Esmond brought it to my attention he dealt with it effectively and with kindness Along with the rules mentioned above he also said that the air-mattress was not permitted although I couldn't find that rule on the Airbnb website nor the sheet he left me  That was cleaned up between Esmond and I and we were back on the road to a good stay Until I experienced a small amount of despair when the building  informed me that per Esmond's contract with the condominium Airbnb's are not ever permitted in the building I went to look for the sheet Esmond had left me upon arrival and it did state for me to tell anyone if asked that Esmond is my cousin I would've rather Esmond messaged that to me prior to the stay or listed it on the site as it possibly would have changed my mind when deciding to stay at an Airbnb where I would have to for lack of a better word lie to someone With that said I apologized for his inconvenience as I in retrospect ideally should've communicated with my roommate the specific details and inquires set forth by Esmond prior to our stay None the less I am pleased with the stay I had with Esmond and the issues we experienced throughout the stay were simply a small line of communication errors ,4

175736,6215083,110473678,2016-10-26,13121861,Necla,One of the best airbnb experiences I ever had Betsy is incredibly open and welcoming always reachable both before the time of arrival as well as during my stay The apartment itself was exactly as described Keeping in mind that this was a shared accommodation I had the entire living room to myself and never felt like I was intruding her privacy Needless to say it was very clean tidy and had everything you need for a short city trip The apartment is located in the up and coming area of Williamsburg with very good and fast connections into Manhattan (M J & L line) It's just a few stops from the Lower East Side and takes you both uptown and downtown Supermarkets grocery stores cafés and restaurants all around the corner or opposite the building Really had a great stay and would book Betsy's place at anytime Also make sure you take some time to have a glass of wine with Betsy after touring NCY all day there's no better way to get to know a city than spending time with locals Highly recommended,4

711855,7850400,110856353,2016-10-28,59279720,Gary,Haim's place is well positioned to the subway There are plenty of food and bar/cafe options nearby and the area was quite safe Haim's place is very clean and had good ammenities However a couple of issues to be mindful of - particularly if guests are aged Access upstairs & downstairs is via a spiral staircase which may be difficult for some people Secondly there is no toilet downstairs which may be an issue for those late night visits if you are sharing the accomodation with others So these are minor issues which didn't impact on our stay  Overall our accomodation was quite comfortable and Haim was only a phone call away if we needed him We thoroughly enjoyed our time in NYC and I recommend Haim's place to stay ,5

598064,8016747,53685712,2015-11-11,13266520,Sinead,We had a great time staying in this apartment The bed was really comfortable the kitchen area was more spacious than I had thought it would be from the pictures and the location was phenomonal So many great places to eat and drink on your doorstep We loved Lower East Side and especially Clinton Street where we felt very safe and happy Beautiful furnishing and great facilities The only downside was that because the location is so cool and popular it was a bit noisy at night The restaurants have back gardens with customers in until fairly late and the next door neighbour liked to party Would absolutely suit people who are staying out late too it wasn't too bad but I took a while to adjust to the time difference and so suffered a little trying to get an early night for the first couple of days However New York is the city that never sleeps so I guess I was the one in the wrong ,3

143266,3219614,15116752,2014-07-02,1807537,Nick,The owner was flexible with arrival times and provided a very through info doc before arrival plus some handy maps a really nice Secret New York guide book and a bottle of wine in the apartment We didn't meet in person on arrival and the lock was automatic (phone call to unlock) It's worth noting that there is a rotating crew of concierges and we got quite a grilling the first two times we arrived - it felt like we were having to really talk our way in the first time and then we were always somewhat uneasy on each subsequent arrival I guess they were just doing their job but it wasn't a very welcoming experience and we got the impression we definitely shouldn't mention we were paying guestsThe apartment itself is clean and modern with an amazing view pointing downtown over the New Yorker hotel The shared roof terrace - note that the building is about  stories - has stunning views including the Empire State and was great for a quiet eve with a few drinks before heading out It's a well connected but quite urban part of town - mins walk to Penn station and Times Square and near Hells Kitchen for midtown food placesOne thing that left a bit of a bitter taste was that in the middle of our stay Yan installed a webcam while we were out pointing at the door from the lounge It's worth noting that this was under a box with instructions to remove the box only for checkout but out of curiosity we looked up the model and it does appear to constantly stream sound to a web server Even if it was off I found the sudden unannounced presence of a camera a little creepy and expect some guests would be quite unimpressed I've stayed in lots of airbnb places and this was a firstOverall a very clean and modern apartment and a good price given the amenities the location and the view Only let downs were the awkwardness with the concierge and webcam,4

561373,1151209,8426363,2013-10-30,7948541,Orsalia,I have to say that this is the first time that I ever used AirBnb and to be honest I was very cautious for the quality of the service Though I decided to give it a chance especially because all the reviews for the specific listing were so good And all these people were right The appartment is very well located the subway is located in a distance that can easily be walked and the most important thing is that you can reach the center only in a few minutes with the subway The neighborhoud was quite and nice people live around the appartment so there is no problem staying there AT ALL As for the appartment it was very clean (really I mean it) it has all the amenities that are needed and Lisa (who by the way was very kind to us and helpful about everything) also gave us an airmatress with electric pump which made my sleep even better because I am really weird with beds and matresses Also the appartment is very spacious for  people it makes you feel like home-tottaly and last but not least lisa also has maps available in the appartment in case you are not already prepared So thats it I think this listing is the BEST choice that you can get in NYCand people trust me  I am a control freak This was the best choice -even from hotels Thank you Lisa ),5

697115,832947,45371325,2015-09-02,24941033,Elio,Comincio dal dire che l'appartamento si trova in una posizione strategica comoda la metro sotto casa (con fermata express) ma i vantaggi finiscono qui La casa non è per niente come si presenta in foto il salotto è veramente piccolo e ci si sta a stento in  ma questo non è un problema le  camere sono molto più brutte di come sono presentate in foto l'intonaco è completamente sollevato dalle pareti creando un effetto bolla al tocco Aprire le finestre è impossibile visto che li in america adottano dei condizionatori incastrati all'interno delle finestre stesse Ma fin qui ci si può arrangiareIl bagno è quasi invivibile nei  angoli in fondo ci sono  macchie molto grandi di umidità o infiltrazioni la finestra per un quarto è sempre aperta c'è solo una zanzariera che è inutile il gabinetto non è fissato al pavimento quindi si muove come il lavandino La vasca per la doccia è macchiata la tenda è intoccabile ricoperta di macchie di muffa Inoltre la casa oltre ad essere ricoperta di linoleum è tappezzata di tappeti sporchi pieni di polvere Infine la cucina che è il locale più abitabile alla fine della fiera era spartita tra noi  ed altri coinquilini notturni che uscivano da dietro il mobile di legno e dallo scarico del lavandino Sicuramente non la consiglio a chi non si sa adattare parecchio e consiglio vivamente di abbassare il prezzo per l'affitto,1
582712,17874595,159071827,2017-06-09,48554,Young Min,his place is near the metro stop and quitemake sure to bring your own hairdryer,5

396781,9479616,140209027,2017-03-28,21145930,Alexis,I stayed at Justin's place for  nights/ days When I first arrived to NY I had only booked for  nights so when I arrived I asked Justin if I could add the extra night and he quickly got the room ready for us There's a subway super close to the apartment The neighborhood is the projects but I felt safe walking late at night there is plenty of light posts and stores near by that makes it feel safer The only issue I had was that there was a LOUD hissing/clunking noise coming from the pipes we weren't aware of this issue until we tried to actually fall asleep the first night However Justin tried his best to see what the building maintenance could do about it and thats all I could really ask for Overall I enjoyed my time at his place relaxing and using his kitchen I recommend Justin's place if you want a Brooklyn experience (,5
284530,11564373,104804992,2016-09-28,57681337,Michael,The stay was very peaceful Makes you feel right at home I would definitely visit again,5

272556,6480042,40953663,2015-08-03,34278479,Jin,I loved staying in this neighbourhood Sole's place is quiet except for occasional subway passing sound that I find quite soothing But if you are a light-sleeper maybe you want another room in the apartment that faces the other side It is in a safe area of the town literally two minutes walk to the subway The N train takes you to everywhere you need to go in Manhattan There are two restrooms on the second floor where I had stayed and I had no problem sharing it with the rest of the visitors in the residence Check-in and check-outs were very simple Sole will msg you about the procedure close to your arrival date and trust me it is EASY I didn't get to meet Sole in person but she was very accommodating and let me leave my luggage for a few hours after my check-out time All in all a great experience The room is clean what you see in that photo is what you will get AC in the room so no worries about the heat I'd stay there again if I had to go back to NY ,5

530309,206071,17139970,2014-08-08,11125022,Tunde,We spent  nights at Loris place ( adults and  tennage children in the bedroom) It was easy to find the location is really good  minutes to Yankees Stadioum metro station If you have low budget it is certainly recommended The appartement is very basic but you have everything what you need in bathroom and kitchen The beds in the bedroom could be better the one is far two high and instable and noisy by every turn The other is practically a matrace on the floorThis is not the right place for newly married couples or for a romantic New York visit But a good solution for families or couples with limited budget Be aware that you have to share bathroom with an inside toilet with a whole family from the living room which can cause quite some waiting times in the morning and evening I would recommend Lori to limit the number of guests  persons is far too much I would have rather payed more and have had more space and privacyDespite of the critics above our journey suceeded very well we had a good place to sleep i have to thank  Lori for this,5

257930,3979194,67126031,2016-03-27,6413589,Brendan,Our visit was towards the end of winter The heating in the building is controlled centrally and we found the apartment to be too far too warm Opening the window to let cold air inside helped though the only window opens out onto a fire escape and so we did not feel able to leave it open overnight The shower is also pretty tricky - fluctuating from very hot to very cold I asked Jo about this and she suggested taking a shower in 'off peak' times which did improve the reliability of the shower a bit On the bright side the location and the neighbourhood are incredible It is a great base from which to see NY Though we didn't meet Jo in person she kept in close contact in the lead up to and during our stay and she was friendly,4

120904,482365,9380020,2013-12-25,3070546,Maurice,I recommend that you strongly consider staying somewhere else This was the noisiest place that I have ever stayed through ARBnB  If you ‘(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)’  W  Street  and to the street view you will see buses from the Port Authority parked in the front and on the side of the building that houses the unit which is a first floor unit with the bedroom facing the sidewalk and sharing the outside wall next to the parking lot The Port Authority uses th Street and the parking lot next to the building as the staging area for its buses meaning that from  am to  am and then again from  pm to  pm you have the constant beeping noise made when buses back up and the constant running and gunning of engines I was so angry that I recorded the sound in the unit to post it on You-tube but decided that was excessive   On the other side of the building a new high rise is being built for which the construction debris is picked up every morning between  and  am and add to that the drunks coming out of the club across the street at  am yelling and screaming at each other and you are not getting any sleep We contacted Lior and complained and were told all of the other units were rented but he would “see what he could do”  Not that I expected him to be able to do anything but he said he would see what he could do and we never heard back from him I wish someone had been more candid about this location or that we had done a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) search and put  and  together Were it not for the fact that we love New York this place would have ruined out trip And this is not mention the electric outlets with no cover plates and multiple plugs overloading outlets the homeless food kitchen that is two blocks away and feeds the many mostly men who beg on the streets all day and us the bus parking lot next door for a toilet at night the only one light working in the bedroom and that half of the ceiling lights in the living room/kitchen were out and we used the stove light for lighting the cockroaches that arrived any time we were out of the room This does not appear to be the rental of someone's home as the kitchen is not supplied for use and doesn't even have a can or bottle openerThere is a reason that this unit is inexpensive and my recommendation is seriously to try someplace else……any place else…really Just (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it,5
718665,6761248,98618964,2016-08-31,63230136,Nikita,Susan was a great host who provided good storage in both the kitchen and bedroom made sure I knew how to get in and out of the apartment without difficulty and was really easy going and nice to chat with The easy access to the subway large apartment and community oriented neighborhood was exactly what I needed and I truly felt at home ,4

244827,9810696,157097165,2017-06-02,5172437,Ingeborg,Het appartement van Jesus was perfect voor een eerste bezoek aan deze prachtige stad Hoewel het zeer dichtbij de drukke en soms luide buurt van Times Square gelegen is was het er zeer rustig óók 's nachts (Oordopjes waren niet echt nodig)Er zijn verschillende metrostations dichtbik waardoor je je zeer snel verplaatst doorheen de stad Dichtbij vind je ook verschillende winkels en restaurants Er is een klein keukentje met koffiezet een douche met warm water en een goede straal en het bed was comfortabel (hoewel ik de matras iets te zacht vond) Verder ook voldoende kastruimte (lades in de slaapkamer en een hanger in de inkom) Voor  personen is het ideaal voor meerdere misschien iets te krapCommunicatie met Jesus verliep ook altijd super snel en makkelijk Tijdens ons verblijf hebben we niet zo veel contact gehad (omdat we dat niet nodig vonden) maar ik ben er zeker van dat hij altijd snel gereageerd zou hebben) Op de laatste dag deed hij er alles aan opdat we zo lang mogelijk in het appartement konden blijven (avondvlucht) hoewel hij diezelfde dag nog nieuwe gasten verwachtte Kortom een aanrader,1

734039,1899076,43358876,2015-08-19,12310637,Leah,My  night stay was only okay and did not live up to expectations after looking at the listing photos and other guest's reviews So this is for potential houseguests to get a clearer idea on what to expect for this listing The neighbourhood is fantastic and I definitely recommend the area Erica was pleasant offered use of her coffee supply and gave me some of her washing powder She leads a busy life so I had minimal contact with her however I felt like a nuisance as on my first night she kept mentioning she needed to get some work done although my contact with her was limited to checking in/initial orientation and needing to use the washing facilities There was a lengthy delay in checking in After arriving in the evening I went away to kill time while waiting for Erica to respond to my earlier text message that I was on my way from the airport (I could not message her from the app at that time) When she invited me to come back I still could not enter the building because I was not given the apartment number for the intercom When she finally let me in there was no explanation for the delay and she was still preparing my room The photos of the living areas do not reflect the current look and feel of the apartment It is more cluttered and 'lived in' with cardboard paintings more furniture and less aesthetic appeal The bed is orientated differently to the photos in the listing which opens up more floor space a positive change I did not find the room restful due to too much internal and external noise Noise doesn't usually bother me and I routinely travel with earplugs I just could not relax The bedroom is at street level near the entrance to the building and next to the entrance of the apartment A group of young guys sit outside the neighbouring building until the early hours of each morning There was street noise like conversations/arguments car alarms sirens music long beeping when people entered the building doors slamming shut thudding footsteps and other houseguests coming and going from the apartment If they let the door slam shut it rattled my bedroom door The bed's spring mattress creaked loudly whenever I moved Internally I heard bathroom noises and could clearly hear conversations even whispered ones Erica used her blender in the early hours of the morning on a couple of occasions There were some other issues which are difficult for the hosts to control like blowflies in the apartment I swatted  one night in my bedroom which came in despite the windows being closed The apartment was poorly ventilated and had an unpleasant smell There was no communication about checking out so I texted Erica about where I would leave the key but never saw a response Just be sure this place is for you before booking Ideally you will be an easygoing,4
268869,12210448,166488804,2017-07-03,46588183,Sarah,Elizabeth and her husband have been nothing but a pleasure to stay with They made us feel like family and that's what's important Another plus is their taste in decor and hospitality Their home was beautiful and very clean I'd definitely return again with my family We adore you Liz and ChianSarah Presley & the kids ,5

610962,1511569,7638338,2013-09-27,8159059,James,This is one of those spots that you don't want to talk about too much because you feel like you're getting away with something Even if John was the worst host of all time this would still be one of the most unique magical places you will ever stay But as luck has it not only is John a spectacular host he's also one of those people whose generosity humor and general life philosophy restores your faith in humanity As a Brooklyn native he can tell you anything about the neighborhood but chances are if you're only staying there a night or two you're going to want to spend a little bit of time BBQing on his huge terrace - and in my case - hanging with him and his super cool neighbors You won't find better value for your money especially not anywhere near this location which is about a five minute walk from the party scene part of Williamsburg Frankly this was probably the best part of my last trip to NY Im going to miss John just as much as i miss the sun coming up over the trees in the park and into my bedroom window Consider yourself lucky to have stumbled upon this listing I sure do ,2

104735,5763191,75214714,2016-05-19,67481505,Meico,For all solo female travelers this is the best place to enjoy your stay in NYFacilities You can borrow most of what you would need during your stay such as a hair dryer or cooking tools Rooms are clean tidy and very comfortable Although I had to sleep at a shared living room I could barely hear any noise You should take the stairs There is no elevatorLocation Close to metro stations and bus stops Easy access to many attractions Very safe even during late at night Major supermarkets variety stores and restaurants are just around the cornerHost Nadia is the best She is a kind and considerate person who can get along with anybody She will teach you everything you want to know about New York Don't worry about your English skill She listened to my poor English patiently Indeed Nadia can care about others She always tried to make it more comfortable for me to stay at her placeThanks to Nadia my visit to New York became a very precious one She even introduced me one of her friends We talked a lot and enjoyed meals and drinks together all of which are my good memories Nadia has become my good friend in New York I miss her a lot nowbut will visit New York again next time to meet her D,5
562517,18585153,172039862,2017-07-19,139189132,Victor,It was well worth the price point The one floor of patrons you're sharing the kitchen and bathroom with is relatively well kept That being said I would recommend bring your own towels and sandals for the bathroom and showering There's a small conscience store just across the street so if you want to make some mac and cheese but need milk you're pretty set any time of day The area is easy to traverse with all of the one-ways but it's a - minute walk to the sub line L so that can be kind of tiresome If you're visiting for the city you'll be walking a lot either way,5
656533,846871,159328758,2017-06-10,4631991,Alvaro,Dee's place is perfectly located It's close to Central Park where the Museum of Natural History is which also makes it a short walk to Strawberry Fields It's also near Amsterdam Ave which is worth walking around looking for restaurants shops cafes ice cream shops etc There's a cat which was no problem for me as she's easy to get along with I'd definitely stay at Dee's place again,5

338591,4885832,65071524,2016-03-10,3395997,Claudia,Unfortunately I did not feel welcome  There were so many issues in this booking it has most definitely changed my feelings towards Airbnb  () Price Increased  I am in NY for business for  weeks  I let the host know that and we negotiated a lower rate  She then said she miscalculated the discount and increased the price and once it was time to pay the price increased again due to additional fees for a longer stay  It was coming close to my departure so I swallowed the higher price()  Cut the availability days before my arrival  A couple of days before leaving for NY the host let me know that I could no longer stay for the  weeks we agreed to  She charged me for two weeks and said that we could negotiate after that  Again this was a couple days before my arrival leaving me no time to find another place  Mid-way through my stay I had to pack all of my things find corporate housing (didn't want to gamble with another host) and move all of my luggage to another rental  She needed the option of returning home because she wasn't feeling well - which I understand but that should've been brought up from the moment I asked for  weeks() Insisted on payment outside of Airbnb  After I arrived the host said that I was required to send her a  personal check for a security deposit  I let her know that Airbnb doesn't allow that since the service is designed to be the secure middleman  She became very rude and aggressive  I reached out to Airbnb and I was correct  () Horrible wifi and telephone service  This is a basement unit but I didn't know the wifi and telephone service were going to be so bad  It would've been a thoughtful heads up from the host especially since she knew I was coming for work() Rules instead of a welcome  The hosts pre-stay email was full of rules - what not to do and what not to touch  So I had to go three days without heat in the bedroom until a friend of mine was able to bring me a heater and a comforter  The bedroom is an add-on so it gets very cold and requires additional heating - that would've been nice to put in the welcome email () Rude host I've stayed with hosts all over and have had wonderful experiences (and great reviews) When I was booking the host required I send her additional references - which I did  She asked for my work information and manager contact - I obliged She was so insistent and because I was time strapped I went along and met her requests  I value my personal property and gave this host the benefit of the doubt In the end this host changed the price cut my stay and made me utterly uncomfortable ,2

683830,17766887,178055857,2017-08-04,6016056,Ernest,Location location location…this apartment has it all  It is right in the middle of Greenwich Village the best location in one of the most exciting cities in the world  Walk out your door and you have restaurants bars shopping jazz music everything  You can walk to the Whitney Museum the Highline the Chelsea market to SoHo…but with all things in life nothing is perfect The apartment itself is modest and small but well equipped  If you are looking for a luxury facility with a fancy bathroom this was not it  But then again with so much to do and enjoy why are you sitting in the room wasting time  The challenge however were the four flights of stairs which you must climb up to get home after a long night of eating and drinking and having fun  If you are under forty this should not be a problem but at  I personally found it painful at times And dragging our luggage up to the “summit” and back down when we left took several trips But in the end it was quite worth it,4

697429,4161013,106485059,2016-10-06,21413554,Svenja,Das Appartement war so wunderschön wie auf den Bildern und wir haben uns nach unseren langen Tagen immer darauf gefreut dorthin zurückzukommen Auch wenn die Ankunft etwas holprig verlief und wir zunächst niemanden antrafen hat dann doch alles gut geklapptDas Viertel ist natürlich nicht Beverly Hills wir haben uns aber immer sicher gefühlt und haben uns sogar sehr glücklich geschätzt das ECHTE New York kennenzulernen und nicht nur die Touri-Version die man vielleicht in einem Hotel in Manhatten erlebtDie Anbindung war auch völlig in Ordnung Von der Subway Station Utica Avenue  (ca  Minuten Fußweg) musste man zu unseren meisten Zielen noch nicht einmal umsteigen und auch die Dauer der Fahrt nach Manhatten hielt sich in GrenzenAlles in allem hat uns der Urlaub und auch das Appartement sehr sehr gut gefallen,5

151107,282977,57026426,2015-12-21,10699039,Roxanne,The room was every bit as cheery and happy as I expected What I didn't expect was to fall so much in love with the immediate neighborhood You cannot get more central in Park Slope than here There's everything from Cafe Martin where you can have an espresso with locals to the bustling Kos Coffee There are no less than two farmers markets nearby and plenty of shops to peruse in the Slope During my whole stay I really felt spoiled for choice here when it came to places to eat nearby (tacos salads sushi the whole shebang) One of Brooklyn's most renowned ice cream spots (Ample Hills) is only a short walk away I felt well taken care of during my stay and would heartily recommend this as a place to hang your hat in New York,5

128724,2398691,195744149,2017-09-20,6714358,Julie,Die Lage des Appartements ist super gut und für New Yorker Verhältnisse ist es ruhig Man kann zwar die Ubahn hören aber das ist halb so wild Das Appartement ist sehr dunkel ist stickig die Klimaanlage extrem laut und die Outdoorspace nicht nutzbar da sie komplett voller Traubenmist ist Wir hatten am ersten morgen direkt eine verstopfte Dusche und mussten den halben Tag im Appartment bleiben und auf Hilfe warten Der Host war immer schriftlich erreichbar und hat sehr schnell reagiert aber dennoch schade das man so seinen Urlaub beginnt Leider müssen wir sagen das wir das Preisleistungsverhältnis nicht passend finden das Appartment müsste dringend mal ein Make Over bekommen Löcher an den Wänden sind einfach mit Tape überklebt Wir haben dennoch das beste draus gemacht waren wirklich nur zum schlafen hier Das abholen und wegbringen der Schlüssel mit dem Keycafe war zwar ok aber wären meine Eltern alleine verreist wär es wirklich schwer für sie gewesen das zu verstehen,2

227936,401039,64241798,2016-03-01,21246246,Anthony,We needed a budget room to stay at for  days while in NYC and Jose & Ysaira's place was good enough for us It is a long train ride from JFK but doable We decided to take a taxi because of our bulky luggage Room was very warm shared bathroom was maintained daily and access to kitchen appliances like the stove was a good bonus Wifi was good and fastWe arrived on a early morning flight with check in set for the late afternoon they allowed us to leave our luggage at the apartment so that we could go spend some time in ManhattanI would recommend to anyone who is traveling light and needs a place to sleep and rest It can be a little tiring taking the train to and from Manhattan everyday (-min) Keep in mind there is a good -min walk from the train station with several flights of stairs and a fairly steep inclined sidewalk before reaching the apartment Nothing to complain about but if your traveling with a heavy bag you'l want to rethink your transport option ,5
452392,886821,144851621,2017-04-16,43137855,Isaac,The room is small but tidy kitchen and restroom are just outside pretty convenient to use On the third floor btw The building is on the street but not busy most of the time I hear birds The neighbors is ok and looks pretty safe five minutes walk to the closest subway  several pub and restaurant on the way and fifteen minutes to downtown Manhattan Kristal is a great host she is easy to communicate and quick to respond I didn't get the chance to talk a bit more with her but I feel she did her best to make me have a good stay there Generally this is a good place for a low budget visit ,5

268279,17222454,196018886,2017-09-21,138232886,Marisa,This trip was the first time I have ever used airbnb so I had no idea what to expect and was a little skeptical especially in a shared space I will not hesitate again  I never met Danielle in person since I arrived late and left early but it was very easy and nice and she explained everything  I was greeted by her  friendly cats one of which slept on the end of my bed and I didn't have the heart to remove him/her  I didn't mind at all It is very close to the airport  I'm sure it could have been walked but they were doing tons of construction to the airport and I attempted but that was a bit nerve-wracking My phone was stolen in Europe so I couldn't order an Uber or call a cab for that matter  However  I had good experiences with the people in NY Most everyone I encountered went out of their way to help me whenever I needed it  When I started out walking to the airport due to my unfortunate phone situation a neighbor in the area saw me and called a cab and stood waiting to make sure they showed up She wouldn't leave me until they did I thought that was very considerate Right before I left the country the week before  a bus driver in NYC went out of his way to draw me a map to where I needed to go  I was impressed all aroundFor planning purposes Cab ride is about  from Laguardia and very worth it but Uber might be even better and more convenientThe room was very nice comfortable clean and homey  I felt very safe there  I highly recommend it especially if you have an early flight at the airport  Its perfect and very reasonably priced,5

721264,2553205,162128034,2017-06-19,124649043,Catherine,We stayed at Melissa's for a week and although we didn't get to meet her in person we did meet Amanda who manages the house she was polite friendly and helpful The house was clean in general bathrooms were spacious and tidy kitchen has plenty of crockery and utensils if you want to cook and there's a nice front porch with chairs and an ashtray The house is literally next to the bus stop which is really handy for getting to the ferry terminal ( mins on the bus and costs  but they only take change or metro cards no notes) The ferry is fre which is really great and drops you off next to battery park in lower Manhattan We did have a couple of issues with the room there is no lock on the door instead there is a cupboard with a padlock on so you can store your things whilst you're out and we were in the only room that does not have a proper door it is a glass door with a curtain on it This made it awkward when people would come back late at night and wake us up by turning the light on Had we have known that in advance we would've booked another room But overall it was a good stay and we would still recommend staying at Melissa's ,5

172230,9453255,57931108,2015-12-30,12402349,Anurag,Brian was a great host He provided clear instructions on getting into the building/apartment He was also very responsive to texts providing guidance and answers very quickly He was also very flexible and allowed us a couple of extra hours on the last day to allow for an easier check outThe neighborhood is great and the location is great but has one drawback - it is rather noisy And the situation is not helped by the fact that the building has poor sound insulation and no way to control heating other than opening the windows I do not think this should stop people from renting this wonderful place but I wanted to share this so people are aware in case they are light sleepers and/or do not want to hear multiple sirens through the day/nightLocation is great and has easy access to public transport groceries and great restaurants Though there is no washer/dryer facility in the apartment the basement has that facility The building is right next to a parking garage making it easy to park and access the vehicle if needed ,3

289669,1475084,161718648,2017-06-18,35846821,Steve,Ana has a beautiful apartment located in the heart of the LES with easy access to multiple subway lines and bus routes The apartment is exactly as described in the listing and is perfect for a single person or a couple looking to explore the restaurants and nightlife of the LES and East Village but with the transport links would also work as a base for general New York exploration The bed is comfortable the kitchen provides everything you'd need the shower is hot and has good water pressure there are good quality sheets blankets and towels provided and plenty of closet and drawer space It exceeded my expectations and is somewhere I'd happily return to on a regular basis I'd especially recommend the Ten Bells wine bar two blocks over on Broome and Attaboy for cocktails just round the corner on Eldridge and there are fine restaurants such as Contra The Fat Radish and Russ And Daughters within a few blocks Only two minor issues anyone visiting should be aware of firstly it is on the first floor on a main avenue and you can definitely hear the NY traffic in the morning I'm a relatively light sleeper and it didn't worry me but could be something to bear in mind if you're a real light sleeper secondly the wifi is painfully slow (around Mbs) It's fine for accessing basic emails and light web browsing but if you need to do anything more heavy duty you may struggle Both minor things that were not a problem for me in any way but probably worth pointing out All in all I spent a perfect five nights at Ana's apartment and highly recommend it ,4

61408,5411787,52221657,2015-10-27,29827004,Taka,This Airbnb unit is probably a better fit for the younger generation than it was for me and my wife (we are in our s)  One issue for us was the two steep flights of stairs - this is not an elevator unit - leading to the rental  Fortunately David helped us to move our luggage up but we did need to get everything down on our ownMy wife and I believe that a younger generation would appreciate the Apple TV and the availability of video games  David did spend some time ( minutes perhaps) trying to orient us to this world of technology but in the end we were more interested in watching the news  This was tricky as the very limited live TV seemed to be antenna based reception which was sketchy  We wished there had been blankets - at least one - provided as there was one day that was chilly  When we realized there was no heat (mid afternoon) we called David  He told us he would call the landlord  We also reported this to Airbnb which may also have contacted David because he called back to tell us that he had contacted a neighbor in the building who said the heat was beginning to come up  We were fortunate to have family nearby  They loaned us a blanket  David also said he would reimburse us if we wanted to buy a blanket but by that time we were uncertain where to make such a purchase since it was Saturday evening and the neighborhood had no clearly identifiable stores to buy bedding  We also had an arrangement to meet David at  pm on the day of our arrival  We called him several times and went to the building three times and rang the doorbell  On the final attempt David did see my wife but since he did not know her he did not respond to the doorbell  We called Airbnb who also tried calling David but with no success  At about  pm David called us from a different number than the one he had given us  He said he thought he had given us the number he was calling from  However neither we nor Airbnb had this numberMy wife and I believe that younger more techno-savvy people would very much enjoy this unit There are however obstacles for techno-phobes such as my wife and myself  ,5
41952,2660412,57166734,2015-12-22,50912349,Leigh,My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights several days before Christmas and loved our experience  Danny made check-in seamless and was extremely accommodating for check-out  The apartment was lovely and unique with all amenities we could have needed (and then some) and gorgeous soft lighting  Easy access to the metro and the park and some great bars & coffee shops--all which Danny recommended  We were within walking distance of my close friend's apartment and I intend to recommend this place to her as a fantastic spot for future visiting friends,4

114132,2051675,65945299,2016-03-18,26943658,Wendy,I went to NYC with my boyfriend  Noel and Patricia's home was very convenient for us  We decided not to rent a car and it was a smart decision after seeing the horrific traffic in NYC  Taking subway and bus was convenient with the help of (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps  Their place was less than a  minute walk to two subway lines that can take us to central park Times Square Rockefeller Centre Barclay Centre and th st for shopping  We have rented another room in Brooklyn prior to our stay with Noel and Patricia and I have to say Noel and Patricia's location was very safe  We felt at ease being able to stay out late after watching a Broadway show  I love their flexible check-in and out accommodations since our other Airbnb location had a strict check-out time  Their place was on the first floor so there was no need to walk up several flights of stairs like other places we have seen  They are very friendly people and their home was beautifully decorated  She had a drawer filled with maps hair dryer shampoo body wash and etc  They are knowledgeable hosts that know their way around  I like that they could give us specific instructions on how to get to a particular place (very helpful)  I know that their place is a bit pricier than other places in Brooklyn but it was worth it considering the safe neighbourhood and accessibility to subway lines to uptown Manhattan  Apparen't all the subway lines are  hours  The last thing I would like to point out is their showers  Not only was their bathroom clean their shower pressure was soothing nice and hot  My boyfriend s really picky with water pressure (having enough pressure) and the hotness and their shower did just that for us  If we visit NYC again we would definitely book their place again,5

461144,6973292,61704719,2016-02-07,55026320,Angel,I had a wonderful experience staying at Lou's for  days Initial impressions were not great because I did not realize the apartment was going to be old  but very quickly Lou showed me that I was very wrong to judge so quickly The apartment is old but kept very clean Not spotless to OCD standards but clean enough that he walks around the house barefoot and I had gotten accustomed to doing so too I was welcomed into the home like a friend given permission to help myself to whatever I needed and would make my stay comfortable Even before I had arrived his communication was amazing always asking if there were any special accommodations I needed During my stay I saw the detail he bothered putting into improving his home so airbnb guests would find it convenient and comfortable  During my stay if he was out at the grocery store he'd text to ask if I needed anything He is truly a thoughtful hostWhat I enjoyed most was Lou's personality If you stay with Lou and don't get to converse with him you're missing out on a huge part of the experience  He looks so serious in the photo but is really such a goofy gregarious guy We could talk for hours if our schedules permitted and his girlfriend is just as awesome During NY stay they made pizza from scratch and we had pizza night together The morning before I left he made chocolate chip wafflesThe day I left Lou walked me to the subway and not only carried my luggage up the steps for me but even placed it in the subway cart for me That was totally unexpected and I am so grateful to have developed this friendship with himI would absolutely recommend staying with Lou if you get the chance PS  during my stay Lou stayed at his girlfriend's apt and I had the place to myself for the most part He would pop back in in the evenings to check on things and do his own workPPS for anyone who is very particular the subway isn't super super close but the walk is a little over half mile I commuted to midtown during my stay for work and door to door (walking waiting and on the subway) time to the th street stop via NQ was half hour PPPS  if you are staying during colder months when heat will be in use and you are a light sleeper his place may not be for you Pre-war radiators are apparently very rattle-y and loud at times,5

139066,171811,20285205,2014-09-27,1179289,Kathryn,This -night airbnb experience met our exact expectations From the beginning Heather was responsive answered a couple questions and then got the keys to us promptly which made us feel secure She even notified us prior to that construction had started around their building and offered us a refund (we are used to construction so we went ahead and it ended up being no issue) The neighbourhood was completely perfect very central and easy two steps to the amazing High Line Chelsea Market wineand chocolate stores Bleeker st Washington Square tons of restaurants subway etc The apartment was overly spacious for only two people with very nice furniture The bathroom must be original but neat to see the old fashioned fixtures And it was spotlessly clean Some more towels and wash cloths for a seven-night stay would have been our only ask I will also add that the bed was very comfortable and the sheets seemed new and were very nice I would recommend this to my closest friends and family and would book it again ,4

751213,1530386,38585928,2015-07-17,29739359,Terry,Nikhil is a great host good communications and very welcomingThe apartment is exactly as described ideal for three or four good decor very quiet and the air conditioning was a great bonus There are four flights of stairs but that was okay for usThe really best thing about Nikhils place is the location The ACE subway is  seconds away Chelsea Market at the corner of the block and the Highline just beyond that Tons of restaurants and bars all aroundRecommended,3

21125,1747440,117226548,2016-12-05,88989684,Alisa,This was my first experience using Airbnb and this apartment did not disappoint  Very modern and updated throughout the tiny bathroom was so nice I would honestly prefer it over my giant bathroom at home The host was easy to contact always answered quickly and left us a bottle of red wine which was so thoughtful  I loved the neighborhood too and the roof top deck provided such a great view I felt like Brooklyn royalty  One thing to note if you have a car we stayed until Monday morning so the parking was a bit of a pain as you have to make sure you are parked on the Tuesday side of the street - if you are staying Friday-Sunday this will likely not be an issue for you at all  The number one reason we would stay again is that it's pet friendly  It's so difficult to find a place to stay even a hotel that understands dogs are family and not everyone has the resources to leave them behind  If you are ready to experience Brooklyn you will not regret staying here,5
327613,240314,163845569,2017-06-25,80491759,Maya,This apartment is a really great value Minor downsides are that there's no AC (but there are fans) and it's a bit inconvenient to need to pick up the keys in a different location from the apartment itself but it's the best decent place you can get for under  in NYC You get a nice room with clean sheets and towels only a block away from a subway stop and a park so I'd definitely recommend it ,4

89337,941642,181195979,2017-08-12,120288098,Benson,Location location location  That was the number one reason for us to choose this apartment and will make us choose it again if we want to return to NY  It is walking distance to Broadway shows close to several subway stops near Times Square and Rockefeller so many great restaurants within a few blocks and a nice relatively quiet street for NY  Being outside of the Times Square/Broadway area the restaurants are aimed more toward locals rather than tourists so quality of the selection of restaurants and markets so much better and not as crowded  Sometimes I feel that the tourist areas are such a rip-off and not worth the price you pay I prefer going where the locals eatOur host was very responsive to questions before and during our stay  This studio is more ideal for a couple or a younger third person  Our -yo daughter was able to sleep on the couch but an adult may have a harder time with it  Everything you need is there for a comfortable stay bedding and linens towels soap (no shampoo) kitchenware with minimal seasonings refrigerator microwave stove toaster etc  We rarely ate in but convenient at least to heat up our leftovers to eat for breakfast,4

585196,2895820,81058229,2016-06-20,75087829,Lewis,Despite turning up later than expected (thanks NYC traffic) Matt was on hand to welcome this Airbnb virgin It was immediately evident I had entered a home rather than just a place to stay especially when greeted by Molly the beagle   Later when I met Tracy we got chatting about all sorts and I picked up some good travel tips The room itself was clean well furnished and had everything I needed But perhaps the best thing about the apartment is the location quiet and central as advertised I arrived on a Saturday and I can attest that the coffee from Everyman Expresso (right below the apartment) is a fine brew and that weekend brunch at The Brazen Fox (right across the road from the apartment) is a very pleasant experience And if you're ever in town and you want to watch some football (or 'soccer' as the Americans insist on calling it) then the apartment is only a five minute walk away from The Blind Pig on East th St - a great sports bar that also doubles as a home away from home for Arsenal fans in NYCMy only sadness was that I couldn't stay an extra night at Tracy and Matt's (not forgetting Molly) Oh and I did win that Award on Monday night guys     Cheers  ,4
714935,4098085,86319088,2016-07-16,71565698,Jerry,The place was perfect  The location is exceptional  Spotlessly clean and plenty of space for personal belongings  The beds were very comfortable and the cooling system worked flawlessly despite  degree heat  I am a stickler for quiet and even though we were on a busy street across from an excellent live music bar it was very well insulated and almost serene with the windows closed  And no noise at all from neighboring apartments  Paulo was highly responsive to various requests throughout the week most notably when we stupidly managed to lock ourselves out of the apartment  Instead of being annoyed he came over on the middle of a work day and brought us an extra key  We will definitely come back if we are lucky enough to have the chance,4

127038,11046927,78428425,2016-06-06,3210054,Emmanuela,"Franklin Guesthouse is one of the BEST reasonably priced most BEAUTIFUL hotel that I've been to thus far and I've been to A LOT Once in your room it doesn't seem like a hotel room at all It's like your own personal apt I rented out the Deluxe Loft Suite with a kitchenette for my family who came to visit for my brother's wedding This was their first time in NYC and I needed a place where they would be completely comfortable within a nice neighborhood where I wouldn't have to worry about them too much while I was gone The staff was very friendly accommodating and helpful in all ways One of my family members is very restricted to what they can eat so it was great to have a whole kitchen available to prepare meals During their -day stay we only had to eat out twice because we were able to grocery shop and cook our own meals That saved us a lot of moneyThere was a couple of cons with the hotel though We were in the basement level so we had no phone reception The only time we could get reception is if we went upstairs to the lobby or went outside to the quaint patio which wasn't ideal because at this time mosquitoes were in the air But the biggest con was the ""sofa bed"" it seemed like an IKEA sofa bed in which the seat unfolded unto the floor as a bed I was so surprise To myself I was like ""You have to be kidding me"" It was super short and super stiff I couldn't believe that's what they had as a bed for guest #- That made me really unhappy to the point I had to bring a foam mattress top from home just to make the ""bed"" a little more comfortable to sleep And the fact it was on the floor made me even more unhappy But the plush comforter and pillows did help But overall it was an EXCELLENT stay",5

652184,692424,36333525,2015-06-27,3046126,Teresa,Nick was very quick to respond to my reservation request  Any questions I had were answered promptly - before my stay and during  The apartment is between nd Ave and  Avenue - Definitely walk up rd Ave anywhere you need to  go since this is a much nicer street  Having said that it is about a  minute walk to Central Park  The inside of the apartment is similar to pictures shown but any hard surfaces need a good paint job  Also the picture of the bedroom is not what we arrived too  There was a white bottom sheet on the bed  On top of the bed there were two grey pillows - No cases and a grey duvet with no cover  Not sure if this is how it was supposed to be but I did not find that very comfortable  Thankfully I found a duvet cover and pillow cases in a drawer along with a top sheet that I could put on the bed  Having said that Nick does do a few things very well - First of all he is very eager to help out with suggestions and knowing that you had a good time Nice apple tvs in both rooms along with nice white towels (no face cloths ()- so take your own from home if you love to use one)  in the bathroom  Also sign in was extremely convenient  The parking garage is close and the building is well managed  I think with a few of these improvements this would take this rental up to amazing,5

132108,234034,75270338,2016-05-20,31486363,Mary,The apartment is very well located a one-minute walk from the Lincoln Center There is a nice diner directly across the street where we had breakfast every morning We walked to Columbus Circle and Central Park in about  minutes The description of the rooms is accurate although the layout of the apartment is rather unusual It is one very long narrow corridor with the main bedroom at one end of the corridor and the living room at the other end of the corridor and the other rooms (kitchen bathroom and second bedroom) in between off the corridor The furniture was rather sparse and basic and the internet only seemed to work in the living room We had to provide our own paper towels and toilet paper and we did not have enough blankets for all of us On the other hand the bunk beds were surprisingly spacious and the bed in the main bedroom was quite comfortable While communication with Marys was good before we arrived it was less so once we arrived and tried to contact her about issues we were having ,4

380646,2980355,103625694,2016-09-23,4246703,Matthew,The apartment is a really great deal for NYC  The location is very convenient being just a block from the express stop on the -- (green line)  And of course you can find absolutely everything including a Whole Foods grocery store within a block of the apartmentIt's compact (to say the least) and the window looks directly at a wall that is just a few feet away  The common areas (kitchen bathroom hall) are definitely in the style of an old New York apartment -- painted a million times and repaired over the years in a rather rough mannerI barely saw (or heard) Mind and his apartment-mates so it was like having the apartment to myself  That being said it's a very cluttered apartment so you definitely have the feeling of being in someone else's home,4

242930,8741053,78976668,2016-06-10,51907788,Jj,Overall we had a wonderful stay in this basement apartment At first when we pulled up the neighborhood has a very industrial almost intimidating appearance however after noticing a few of the homes on the street have been tastefully restore/updated and local hipsters riding their ten-speeds down the street my wife and I decided that this was actually a safe and interesting neighborhood After Walking around you discover there is a pedestrian bridge over the nearby highway that brings you into the Carrol Gardens section of Brooklyn Court Street has many nice restaurants and shops if you are looking to take a break from the bustle on Manhattan Speaking of the th and Smith St train stop is about a  minute walk away with frequent F and G trains to Manhattan The room itself is very clean and updated Edward gave us the contact information for Dan his property manager who was most helpful and friendly When we first arrived the WiFi worked but then disappeared After contacting Edward Dan had it fixed in a few minutes At another point I locked the keys for the room inside and luckily Dan was on site to unlock the door for me The air conditioning worked well as we had a few hot days while we were there One thing to note is that the main picture of a door is not for the basement apartment but for the upstairs units but you can use it to help you find the building The door for the apartment is behind a gate and down some stairs  Overall this was our first experience with AirBNB and would not hesitate to stay in another well-reviews place This place was quite a bit bigger than most Manhattan hotels and much quieter It was also nice having free on-street parking as parking in Manhattan is crazy,4

294141,5511865,146788872,2017-04-23,34860885,Riz,Berry and Rosie were amazing  Very nice people who made sure I had everything I needed for my stay  The location is very close to the train but faces away from it so you don't hear the noise when you come back to relax  So many restaurants and food trucks a block over so you never have to worry about where to grab a bite  Would recommend staying here  ,5

746468,9096381,187723801,2017-08-27,32098465,Vanessa,Tom & Marisa's apartment was a wonderful place to stay The apartment was clean and comfortable with lots of thoughtful touches—basket of snacks extra blankets if the weather changed a map of the transit system and more Marisa was super responsive and made everything very easy and low-maintenance We also appreciated the variety of books that we could easily pick out off the shelves if we chose to do some reading There was some noise from the apartment upstairs—not a problem for heavier sleepers but lighter sleepers might want to bring ear plugs Overall we had a great time staying at Tom & Marisa's apartment and would definitely recommend it,4

714310,66718,42415441,2015-08-13,37489797,Nicholas,Henning's flat was a good choice for us - reasonably priced and in a good location for commuting into town ( minutes into central Manhattan) When there was a problem with the shower the housekeeper's husband was quick and friendly in repairing it including buying a new part Two major downsides are the lack of aircon - Henning recommends a wet towel and the fans to sleep - which makes the flat uncomfortably hot and makes all towels in the humid bathroom musty and the mixed blessing of the Harlem neighbourhood which is pleasantly lively but sometimes too much so when you want to sleep The flat comfortably sleeps  for a short period and could sleep smaller numbers perfectly for a longer period,5
370378,7496720,89393869,2016-07-28,72524595,Thibaud,Appartement parfait et accueil génial Je recommande vraiment Tout était top,1
368632,4218034,87721414,2016-07-21,4880900,Marcia,El departamento muy lindo y muy limpio Con todo lo necesario para la estadía Está un poco lejos de Manhattan si van con niños Pero el barrio es súper tranquilo se pueden caminar con los niños en la noche volviendo del subte sin inconvenientes o salir a hacer ejercicios en la mañana Hay muchos locales para comprar comida El departamento es espacioso y tiene todas la comodidad es Le falta aire acondicionado a las habitaciones en julio hace muchísimo calor en NY y se sufre un poco El pasto del jardín estaba muy crecido y no pudimos disfrutarlo  De todas formas es recomendable Mark siempre atento a todas las necesidades ,1

116171,686485,102554831,2016-09-18,57194564,Fer,Beautiful apartment pictures are just as the apartment is which isn't very common in New York Excellent location and amenities Spacious and beautifully decorated The reason I am giving  and not  stars is because we could've used more specific check in instructions Usually when homes are on Airbnb the host provides a detailed check in email However this listing is a little more informal I had to contact the host for the apartment number and wifi information We had a few issues with registering the names of the guests- a result of miscommunication that resulted in an unwelcoming feeling with the building staff ,4
503584,9078222,146605825,2017-04-23,27475281,Richard,Babajide was very friendly and helpful and showed us around the apartment upon arrival The apartment was clean very well equipped and in a perfect position to get on the subway (less than a minute walk) and into Manhattan The area is safe and has access to food stores and fast food nearby Also very close to Prospect park Highly recommended for a group stay in NYC,4
314953,7125107,123483588,2016-12-29,29533259,Tommy,"This is not an ideal place for light sleepers The walls are very thin and the host has multiple AirBnber's there at a time The deadbolt on the other door is empty and doesn't work You have to use the twist-lock on the doorknob prevent entry from both doors I wish this information was available being rudely told to ""learn to read directions before booking an Airbnb"" over the phone by the hostThe breakfast is a gimmick Don't bother with it There were only two bagels which were not fresh they felt quite hard so I did not bother to eat them Water is available as tapToiletries might be scarce The body wash container was empty during my stay",2

485691,375249,2739896,2012-10-28,3855705,Cécile,We had a really nice in this lovely house  The bed is really comfy and we had our own bathroom The bus stop is right accross the street so it is not difficult to go to Manhattan but keep in mind that all in all  (bus  waiting time  ferry  subway) it could take you about  hours to get where you want to go (especially if you want to go to the north of Manhattan)But we knew that before so we knew what to expect and the room is so cool that it is worth it  There is a TV and James gave us some DVD we didn't have time to watch them but we appreciate this idea  )It is exaclty like on the pictures ,5
15524,1525602,34210728,2015-06-06,31737398,Lara,El apartamento era como estar en casa muy acogedor y cómodo Y Andrea nos puso muchas facilidades tanto para el check-in como para el check-out siempre localizable El barrio nos gustó mucho Decidimos optar por este apartamento en Brooklyn para alejarnos un poco de lo típico de Manhattan y la verdad que estamos muy contentos Además el metro estaba muy próximo con el que en  paradas podías estar en Wall Street ,1
26355,15083737,121128297,2016-12-14,42755250,Emily,Howie's place is all about the location - being directly next to a metro station makes it a breeze to get into and around Manhattan Despite being so close to the metro we couldn't hear the trains from our room The only downside to Howie's place was having  guests all competing to use one bathroom which sometimes made it hard to get ready and go in the mornings Despite this it's still good value for it's price ,5
419429,16335618,121125586,2016-12-14,106314532,Fethi,Adil was a outstanding host This was my second Airbnb experience and by far the best Made us feel very welcomed from online communication to in person Getting in the apartment was very easy with the code lock Getting into Manhattan was also a breeze with nearest train station being a block away I’d highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet and clean stay Free parking in the house was a huge plus,4
485226,13766130,89131741,2016-07-27,85351354,Michelle,I actually already live in Williamsburg but had a last minute repair that required me to be oiut of my apt for the night so when I booked this i had very little time to plan ahead and had very few expectations and the entire experience far exceeded any that I had  The entire stay was easy and getting settled in was seamless and welcoming Andrew was a great host responding promptly and happily whenever I reached out to facilitate my arrival  He gave me my privacy but also made sure that I had everything I needed and even offered me some refreshments when I arrived  As a current brooklynite the location was the best aspect of my stay  The apt is in a fantastic (and safe) part of south williamsburg -- it was half a block away from the concert venue Baby's All Right where I was coincidentally attending a show on the same night (after the show ended I was back to my room within  minutes)   I'd definitely recommend this airbnb to any interested,3

646802,5031178,61303935,2016-02-02,52818789,Lauren,A great place for a live-like-a-real-New Yorker experience This part of Brooklyn is a tad edgy but super up-and-coming and the neighborhood peeps are generally friendly and welcoming It's still NYC so a certain vigilance to your surroundings is called for but that would serve you well anywhere you travelClose to three trains - an easy walk - but the L was the most reliable during our stayThe apartment is great Only things we would change is the couch in the living room - it's pretty but hard for more than one person to veg out on after a long day of wandering - and some direct lighting here and there (table lamps) would help those of us with old eyes -)The hosts are extremely responsive and communicative We are definitely going to book again when we come back to New York,5

514309,7709150,106510086,2016-10-06,12861587,Kristina,The town home/listing is a hostel/dormitory type feel in that it's many different guests from different places staying here with multiple common areas Everything was very clean upon my arrival and the host was very accommodating because my flight arrived very early Room was tiny but that's to be expected in NY big comfy bed makes up for it The only problem I would say were the stairs/ hallway they seemed done as an after thought and being that I'm tall I had to make sure to duck coming up/going down the stairs and kept tripping on the top  steps ,5

742657,2071546,40140851,2015-07-28,26085990,Gyuwon,Generally it was okay When we arrived he was not there but he let me know passwords and where the room is in advance so it doesn't matter The room was kind of different from the pictures on airbnb but it was good enough so we were satisfied about our room It has really good air conditioner which we used it very efficiently (the room doesn't have any window but it was ok because of that) I just talked with him very shortly but he was very nice and kind I heard there are  cats but actually it was  cats even though I hadn't seen the other cats except  They were very friendly so if you like cats it would be perfect for you However the kitchen needs more furnitures for cooking like more dishes and more pots and it might not be clean enough Also you should notice that it was just not for you and your host It was like a hostel so if you expect just normal airbnb house it might not be for you Location was perfect It has  subway stations within  minutes each and literally everything is walkable such as grocery store post office and coin laundry Also it was quite safe If you need a place I think it's reasonable choice,5

426040,55467,171420519,2017-07-17,29259029,Ayman,We enjoyed staying at Paul's place A good location to explore Williamsburg (which you definitely should if you go to NY) It's also  mins away from a hr store so you will always find something if need be The place was clean felt safe and definitely did the job There is a fridge and washing facilities Paul himself was extremely helpful He responded to messages very quickly and always had an answer to any question The only thing to bear in mind is that it is a basement room so there is not much in terms of natural light The porch is also part of the main house so you have to go up if you want to use it rather than just opening the door and there you are,5

318585,13730284,157346454,2017-06-03,108784976,Ryan,I will start with the positives Barbara offered us an early check-in as we had just arrived off the ship Communication was very fast and we were met by her assistant The place was clean  spacious with some greenery in the backyard The location is fairly decent there were however some sketchy people walking around the neighbourhood The street next to it is full of all kinds of degenerates and the neighbourhood is very dirty You are in Manhattan  which is nice but expect to take an hour to walk to  midtown Prior to booking  a month before arrival I brought up the wifi issue with the host who stated it was high-speed and not an issue Unfortunately the wifi was not resolved on our arrival Her assistant did arrive with a hotspot box but it was slow Their main internet worked for  night  then stopped working again The other main negative is this very loud motor/generator sound that occurs all day at regular intervals  Upon investigation we found it coming out of the electrical room directly below the kitchen living area It can be heard all day  although it is slightly muffled out in the bedroom Another issue is you are on ground floor and the hallway outside gets very loud at night  On  occasions late at night  the exterior door was left open and the alarm went in sounding for a good  minutes  The beeping alarm can be heard in the bedrooms and throughoutTo summarizeClean place wonderful beds and sheets walkable location towards midtown with city sightsLoud noises( electrical people leaving door to apartment building open and alarm sounding ) spotty WiFi sketchy area with lots of homeless and people that looked like opportunists ,5

259879,16793684,163695065,2017-06-25,116333801,Lauren,We had a very pleasant stay with Chance My husband and I had just gotten in from an international flight and used her apartment as a place of rest before completing our long drive back to our home in Ohio Chance was very flexible with our later check-in time which we greatly appreciated The bedroom is quite clean and comfortable though I will point out that there is no AC (which was perfectly fine given the fact that both nights were cooler and she had the room equipped with a window fan) Many reviews point out that this apartment isn't actually  minutes from Manhattan however we found that it actually is exactly that distance by car The subway commute is a bit longer but the station is a short walk from the apartment which is quite nice I would also like to add that when we were having trouble getting into the apartment by ourselves one evening Chance was quick to respond and came right to the apartment to let us in (despite being off site) All in all were very grateful to have this conveniently located spot available to us ,4

729548,9219472,76887645,2016-05-29,68375533,Abdelhadi,Being my first trip to NY I kept my expectations at a reasonable level just because I wasn't going there as a tourist Had this not been the case my review would have been very negativeValeria and her friend were very kind helpful and very patient with my trouble kids and I am grateful for thatThe neighborhood is quiet scary at first sight for someone not from the city I had to walk at around PM to grab some food and while you can still see people walking around you still have this unsafe feeling just by counting how many homeless people pushing their carts full of garbage bags and the sorry look on their faces it's sad to see but then you would think this is how it goes around hereBack to the room the day happened to be hot to a sweating level and with no A/C it wasn't going to be an easy night Fast forward to AM I woke up counting how many times I survived heart attacks by waking up to a wracking garbage truck going mph thru the intersection or firecrackers that sound like gun shots at first guess or some dude who thinks it's ok to drive at AM with full loud R&B at the end it was obvious that there is no way I can spend one more night in this placeI don't want to sound negative to the point where I would not recommend it to others I know there are people who like the crazy loud type of life and are perfectly used to it This might be a perfect spot for them but for me it was a nightmare and I had to leave earlier than expectedPS If you happen to be driving note that you will have to find your own street parking spot Good Luck with that I was lucky enough I parked some  ft down the street,5

10079,6740840,42287295,2015-08-12,29848533,Richelle,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying with Giocomo in Williamsburg It made our trip to NY all that better Giocomo is a really cool guy very welcoming and laid back We felt very comfortable staying there with him and getting to know him The room/apartment was exactly as described and very clean The futon was really comfortable nice and firm like futons are The apartment was situated in the best position - close to the action transport but quiet enough that you had the option of un-winding and relaxing The yard out the back is pretty special particularly in Brooklyn where yards are not common  After a long day of walking and traveling in Manhattan and Brooklyn it was good to have the option of chilling out watching HBO on the big screen in the room having beers out the back or some nights we would venture out again to see live music It was really hot in early August when we stayed but the apartment was cool and a small fan was all we needed to be comfortable at nightTraveling and cycling around was just so easy The L and M lines are a few blocks away it takes literally  minutes to walk to them and you're in Manhattan within  minutes The weekly pass makes this a particularly cheap way to travel Giocomo was able to recommend some great places to visit and provided really easy directions to get to his house from the airport We would LOVE to stay with Giocomo again I can't imagine a better set-up or location We felt so fortunate to stay with and meet Giocomo and hope he and his family stay with us next time they visit Australia again Thanks Giocomo for such a brilliant stay in NYC D,4

405420,4709568,178762921,2017-08-06,4261035,Peter,Our family enjoyed our stay at Meritxell's apartment  As most have commented on the location next to the Highline is wonderful  It is less easy to get crosstown if this is a requirement for you  We used the subway once to get to Brooklyn which was easy  Other times we walked and took Uber or Lyft if a bit further  If you are not rushed for time the location is convenient to most places in Manhattan  The apartment is well stocked with household supplies which makes cooking meals convenient and two full baths a bonus for NY It is evident she lives in the apartment as we prefer to rent from home owners and not businesses that are all over Airbnb  The communication with Meritxell was quick and transparent  Meritxell is a lovely host as is her apartment We would love to stay here the next time we are in NY  One of our best stays on Airbnb ,4

510954,271083,163125097,2017-06-23,5896924,Dora,El departamento está ubicado frente al espectacular Prospect Park de Brooklyn   Es un edificio clásico dividido en dos cuerpos y está en el cuarto piso (tercero para los argentinos) con un amplio ascensor automático Tiene  habitaciones cocina y baño y hay varios placares alguno ocupado con ropa del dueño El del dormitorio tiene espejos de cuerpo entero Nosotros éramos solo dos personas pero el departamento permite que hasta  estén cómodos lo que representa una excelente relación calidad/precio Del edificio a la avenida Parkside donde hay una estación de metro hay  metros hacia el sur y de la avenida Lincoln hay  metros hacia el norte y hay otra estación de metro En la misma puerta del edificio tiene la parada el bus B que conecta con la zona de Bay Ridge en el sur de Brooklyn y sobre el río que es muy céntrica y con zonas muy elegantes y para nosotros fue un lindo paseo y muy cómodo hacer el recorrido de punta a punta y conocer gran parte del BoroughLa avenida Parkside y la Flatbush que está a una cuadra constituyen un centro comercial donde es fácil encontrar donde aprovisionarse lugares para    comer y tiendas En metro se tarda alrededor de  minutos hasta Manhattan Es de destacar que Brooklyn tiene de todo y están todas las marcasKevin resultó un anfitrión excelente Nos esperó a la llegada y vino a despedirnos cuando nos fuimos Los horarios de entrada y salida los establece de forma flexible lo que representa una enorme comodidad y nos sorprendió invitándonos una noche a cenar Ya al entrar nos había dejado para nuestro consumo una gran cantidad de botellas de agua mineral Por supuesto que volveríamos a su departamento,1

655806,15296557,115177252,2016-11-22,20857259,Robert,If you're looking for an authentic experience of Brooklyn's hottest neighborhood look no further - complete with roommates close to trains and nightlife hotspots it's as Bushwick as you can get The space felt like actually living in an apartment except for the little details that Christina kindly provided - earplugs shampoo etc Perhaps not for those light sleepers but that might be the case anywhere in the city I'd recommend the apartment to all,4

281254,603948,7613674,2013-09-26,2943332,Brian,HEAVEN Jennifer's apartment is an island of tranquility on the island of Manhattan The apartment is quiet bright and quite spacious by NYC standards Waking up with the sunshine streaming on to the bed is nothing short of perfection The building itself was so conveniently located to subways Central Park and everything I neededI didn't get the opportunity to meet Jennifer in person but she went above and beyond what most hosts will do I arrived to muffins that she had baked special for me a pitcher of filtered water and a list of vegetarian restaurants (created special for me) PLUS plenty of information about eating shopping and going out in the neighborhood While we didn't get to connect in person she was perfectly attuned to my needs via text and really went above and beyond to insure my comfortOne of the things I really LOVE about AirBnB is the opportunity to experience a more legit living experience in the cities that I visit While not a negative people SHOULD understand that living situations in NYC are different than in other places in the US The building IS older and the apartment IS on the th floor with no elevator This is pretty typical for New York and I was grateful for the exercise but if you might have a problem with this you should probably stick to a chain hotel in Times Square,4

541537,271279,7666645,2013-09-29,3309408,Justin,Aaron was super accommodating with respect to our check in and check out needs Communication was never a problem He was always available to answer question before and during our stayThroughout our visit we felt safe and secure in the neighborhood and the apartment On a couple of occasions we did have to close our windows because of cigarette smoke coming from a neighbor in the building but that really is my only complaint  The location was quiet which we appreciated every morning - some of our friends were staying a few blocks away in a different part of Greenpoint and were greeted at am every morning with delivery trucks and forkliftsTip We found that Manhattan taxi drivers were not very familiar with the Greenpoint area Local car service was a great option especially from the airport Car service to/from JFK was  plus tip,4
661745,2069359,22226619,2014-11-02,18002918,Ivonne,Me and my boyfriend stayed at Pam & Julliens for  weeks The night we've arrived Jullien welcomed us with a friendly smile and wished us farewell when we were leaving We didnt meet Pam though but we have been outside to see the city the whole time anyway When we first got there a map was provided as well as water - since we got there very late The offered room looks exactly like in the picture It's very clean and pretty and you definitely got everything you need a fridge a microwave cups paper plates towels and enough room to stow your belongings Also the bathroom was really nice and clean Even though the place is kinda far away from the city there is a subway station only like  minutes far away by foot where you can catch the A and C trains that go directly to Manhattan ( min with the A train) Everytime we had a question or needed something Jullien was there to help us out WiFi works perfectly well and even if you have flat mates you wont get in each others ways But since the walls are very thin (due to the american way of building houses) you can hear like every step and every word also the wooden floor is quite noisy when you walk on it But it's just something you need to get used to Even though we didn't talk much (since we've been walking around Manhattan all day long) they were great hosts - very friendly helpful and so warm-hearted They really made us feel like home Its so much more comfortable and nicer then staying in an hotel The room really is high quality and since this was our first airbnb experience it couldnt have been better It was really fun our stay was just awesome We can both just recommend it Thank you so much for everything,5
75311,394474,7307327,2013-09-15,8030427,Kay,For the stellar location of this apartment it is a great value price-wise Eddie was a great host at checkin answering our questions carrying our bags up the stairs (THANK YOU) and giving us advice on getting around  We did try and reach him to figure out the TV (what he told us to do wasn't working) but it was on a Friday night and we did not expect him to be at our beck and call- we never heard back  The only reason I rated this so low overall is because the apartment was super HOT the first night we stayed there and that was an issue for  menopausal women prone to hot flashes  I think the window unit in the front bedroom froze up because it wasn't cooling at all despite being turned on upon checkin  The AC in the kitchen worked great but it blew against the side of the stove and the air didn't circulate well  We turned off the non-functioning AC for a few hours and the second night was much more comfortable  You ARE in the thick of Manhattan so it is not quiet- ever  Beer delivery starts early so wear earplugs to sleep past am  The bathroom is very small but functional and everything worked  Furnishings were nice beds comfy  The floor was not very clean on the bedroom-there was a lot of dirt/hair/dust around a pipe in the corner at the floor  Other than that one area very clean place  We never did figure out the TV but since we were only there  nights it was fine  We didn't come to NYC to watch TV  This would be great for  people but  was a bit tight  For the area and price a great value and decent place,3
718421,263005,68305639,2016-04-04,50441833,Belinda,The listing for this property was very accurate  It's within easy walking distance to DUMBO  We had no problem walking to little grocery store and subway system  We felt very safe  The apartment is small but has everything you need for an enjoyable stay  We loved the little place  Marissa was very helpful  Her response time was quick  The place was clean and cozy  Though we did not cook except for a light breakfast it seemed to have everything you needed if you chose to do so  I found it a very quaint and charming place and I would definitely stay here again  There was not a thing we couldn't find within a miles walk  ,5

755001,631747,45243611,2015-09-01,2186759,Christine,Ashley was always quick to respond to any communication we had leading up to our stay as well as while we were there  She was most helpful when we needed to change the reservation to add another person and when we asked to change our payment methodHer apartment was listed accurately  In fact she should add that her place includes air conditioning in both bedrooms  We were thankful to have this during the hot summer month of August  We stayed at Ashley's for the month of August and her apartment was the perfect place to rest and relax after our long days of exploring NYC  The apartment was clean and quite large  We had  adults staying in the apartment and there was more than enough room for us  There was an extra air mattress provided which we used in the main bedroom next to the regular bed  The two air mattress beds and regular bed were all comfortable to sleep onAlthough the apartment was in Upper Manhattan and further from the action it was an easy quick subway ride away  The subway entrance was just outside the doors of the building and the A line (an express) took us downtown in no time  The only time it took longer was late nights on weekends  At those times we often took a cab back to the apartment instead  We were  easily able to take the train and bus to and from LaGuardia Airport which saved us some money  The neighbourhood was safe and there is grocery stores restaurants and coffee shops a quick walk away I would stay here again if heading back to NYC and would recommend it to others  Thank you Ashley for making your place available to us,4

765719,10010845,124713480,2017-01-02,4986660,Beata & Tony,Not recommended at all The description is misleading - it's is for max  people and not  as described There's only seating for  in the kitchen which is very cramped The listing says the flat is 'comfortably spacious' but in fact it is nothing of the sort it is in fact VERY small more like a studio We waited  minutes for check in (winter) and had no response from the host re check out There's also noise from the water pipes in the room next to the bed and from the delivery office across the street throughout the night/morning and the place wasn't clean All in all a very disappointing stay in a poky overpriced apartment which didn't match the description ,5
115203,7859630,44587492,2015-08-27,3720221,Craig,Sean was very easy to communicate with and accommodating especially when it took longer than anticipated to get from the airport to the condo and when I accidentally locked myself out His housemates were all super nice and helpful too The room is on the basement floor and is very simple but when you're in New York you don't stay indoors anyway so it's good for someone who just needs to crash and shower The overall condo is nice and recently renovated - even has two bathrooms with showers in them Even has a rooftop patio that can be used The condo also has a shared washer/dryer which is essential on long trips Bed-Stuy itself is a really interesting neighbourhood that's going through a lot of transition Despite what people might think there were no problems whatsoever no matter what time of day or night you're walking The condo is well situated -  minute walk to a grocery store a smoothie spot Angel Fish Market (steamed salmon) Wal-Greens (which is a drug store) and two subway stops on the J line (which basically run all night) There are also multiple corner delis if you need something quickly The bars I went to are about a  min walk but both Bed-Vyne Brew and Casablanca have a great vibe There are multiple bus stops also really close by and they run pretty frequently during the day So you can get anywhere you need to within Manhattan or other parts of Brooklyn within a half hour to  mins or so via bus and train I also rented a bike via spinlister (think airbnb for bikes) and biked around New York for a day There are some streets with bike lanes on them close by too Although I didn't see Sean or his housemates much they were all super nice when I did meet and talk with them and helpful if I had any questions Overall a great trip and a nice spot to rent ,5

360734,565531,13704813,2014-06-02,5820268,Sarah,I had stayed at Bill's apartment for a week while I was in town on business  The location was great very close to the th Ave subway stop which takes you anywhere you want to go in and around town  It is also very close to Chelsea Market and the High Line  The apartment itself was great lots of bright light hardwood floors and a comfy bed  Bill was very helpful and communicative  The main room lacked a couch and the only working tv was in the bedroom  However in NY you don't spend that much time indoors so I was fine just coming in and sleeping each night after eating out with work friends  I would definitely recommend Bill's apartment if you find yourself in need of an affordable safe and conveniently located apartment in Chelsea,4
396696,284866,107812391,2016-10-12,78023159,Kristin,Let me first start to say this location was amazing It is right near so many restaurants bars and the train The place itself was cute and small we felt like we fit right in with the New Yorkers The building seems a little old and has an old smell when you walk in the building but the apartment is well taken care of and has no odor The rooms are located on each side of the apartment which is great for privacy The kitchen is tiny and located in the front room no biggie for us we ate out most of the time She also has the cabinets with plates and cups etc The view outside the windows face Clinton and all the beautiful trees down the blockThe rooms are a good size and the beds are comfy Also the street is small but has lots of traffic and can get pretty loud but we didn't want to sleep in anyway so I wasn't so mad about it ha The bathroom was a little  small but typical for New York We ran out of toilet paper and Mai said she would have the cleaners run us a few rolls but I was out and about so when I replied later since I was out and about all day She replied that we already were stocked with two and we can just buy our own roll which was a bit disappointing because we didn't want to run around looking for toilet paper but other than that the whole stay was pleasant and that did not affect the stay at all In closing not sure if Mai knows but the front door knob was broken and we couldn't turn it we had to push it open each time The bathroom door is also needs to be picked up to close the door In closing I was happy with Mai's place and detailed instructions this made the pick up of keys and location of train so much easier Thank you Mai for stay If we are in NY we will consider Mai again I recommend to anyone that wants to feel like New Yorker Thanks Mai ❤️,4

447532,3411006,163887872,2017-06-25,45446199,Robyn,This apartment is exactly as it is presented in the pictures and was fit for purpose for our family of  adults and  teenage girls The best feature is the location - just  metres to an underground station that took us down to Union Square (which was also within walking distance) and anywhere we wanted to go within a few minutes Just a couple of observations - the apartment is on the th floor with no lifts It was fine for us but if you are not so fit you might want to plan your day to keep your trips up and down to a minimum Another consideration is noise We expected NYC to be noisy and we're fine with this but if you don't like hearing ambulances and fire-trucks frequently you might need to take this into account All in all we were all very happy here and would recommend Dee's place to other similar aged families,4

262145,6611547,34499380,2015-06-08,33463279,Kate,Andrew was extremely accommodating with our early check in We had a nice chat when we arrived to pick up the key and after that we never saw him or anyone else in the house Check out was easy and convenient to our schedule The space is extremely private quiet and clean The basement room has very little daylight except for a back door leading to the shady garden which makes it perfect for staying out late and sleeping in during the day A little rumble from the nearby subway train is no big deal The bed was very comfortable We loved our stay there I have family living on a nearby street and I have already told them to refer people to stay at Andrew's house I would definitely stay there again The only down side to this place is that I had no cell phone reception inside and had to go outside to the patio to make calls and check text messages Luckily the weather was nice and the patio was private,5

162200,9887654,112203558,2016-11-04,30175383,Elizabeth,We stayed at Kaci's for the first few days of an NYC vacation The location was great We saw lots of Brooklyn and felt less like tourists staying in an apartment in the city It's not quite for kids and though far from Manhattan it's just as noisy as anywhere else in NYC so don't expect a peaceful stay The kitchen was nice but there are very limited tools to use (cookie sheets toaster spatulas etc) so it's mainly extra space but you'll probably still be eating out a lot Overall it didn't meet our expectations but would be perfect for people without kids or who want a more rustic experience,4

126763,492785,1385957,2012-05-30,2437370,Jason,Michelle and her condo were outstanding It is as advertised single floor for single group occupancy Queen bed adequately equipped kitchen newly finished bathroom with whirlpool DishTV She provided excellent help regarding things to go do and see and was available by phone or text for any small questions that developed Available when necessary but gave us complete privacy throughout You get your own floor own locked door to the unit The neighborhood is safe but mixed appearance though her house is in a very safe part A/C and G stations were nearby Definitely would recommend this for groups of -,5

8270,956412,88178908,2016-07-23,31809493,Andrea,The location of this was really good with an incredible place to eat (Superfine) right around the corner  The apartments was modern and bright  Unfortunately the air conditioning was not working nor did it appear that the owners considered this in light of our renting the apartment  We reported it right away (Thursday) and despite them having a repair person check in out on Friday morning we had to call the owners on Friday night when it hadn't been fixed  Only then did they tell us that the blower wasn't working  They clearly knew earlier in the day that it wasn't going to be repaired and did not furnish nor offer to furnish fans until we called them at pm  Needless to say - no fans appeared,4

483320,63320,21082696,2014-10-11,19939380,Ronja,I spent four days at Jay's place on Staten Island  For me it was the perfect place to stay at for a New York trip  I was travelling on my own and arrived pretty late in the night  Eventhough I always felt secure while by ferry or by Bus in this area  The room was also very nice It had everything that I needed  even a tv  which I did not expect The shared bathroom was also pretty clean the whole time I was there  but that always depends on the other guests  Sometimes one has to wait quite a bit until the bathroom is free to use  as there is only one for up to  people  For me it was totally okay  but it might be important to people who have appointments I was very happy with my stay in New York / Staten Island  Thank you,5

633073,15915152,137968646,2017-03-18,802455,Philippe,"I must say that i was a little disapointed by Vanessa 's place Athough I was initaily pleased for a couple of hoursthe Boodha  the candles the pictures but I very quickly saw the downs of the place and no it is not a ""celestial place"" Vanessa's  place is nicely Furnished and decorated and comfy and clean which is great But it is dark I understood why Vanessa's rules forbid you to open the living room windows Not only you cannot open them but you cannot see through them and the reason is that Vanessa cleverly put mirrors in front of them because all you could see is a dark wall  cm away So yes it is a good idea to put mirrors the outside wall is not nice but that means the room is dark and you have to switch the light on at all time The bedroom has windows but as you are on the main road with constant traffic  you do not want to open them too often the traffic is bad in this area If the upstairs neighbours are in you'll be able to follow their foot step above your head All this bothered me but might not bother anyone else As i said the place if small is nicely decorated and cosy Communication with Vanessa was good but distant and i didn't get any reply to my last mails before leaving but she might still have been on her retreat I pesonnaly do not like the keycafe system to pick up and drop your keysVery inconvenient and adding time to your journey but making life a lot easier and cheaper to the host But again that is just me I might have liked a few more info about where to put trash how to us the TV  where to find the internet passwordetc but as I travel a lot I managed The bed was good the internet fast and the shower was hot I didn't have a bad time but that was not what I was expecting from the descriptions and for a celestial place I would expect a few ""dos"" and not only ""don't"" from the house rules However if you visit as a tourist and busy sightseeing which i was not you'll might have a different feel It is still a cosy and atmospheric little flat",5

202638,63693,22948964,2014-11-18,21923737,Marina,The Cottage in the Village is lovely I grew up in NYC and I travel there quite frequently yet I have never stayed in such a special little place  We visited in November when it was cold and wet but the central heat and ample hot water kept us warm The kitchen was well-stocked with many spices oils etc which made cooking a breeze There were many useful items in the cottage such as bath products hair dryers curling irons etc To stay in NYC  - specifically in the LES which is pretty noisy - in a private quiet space with no shared walls is truly a treat And having two bathrooms is a luxury -) This might be a little esoteric the experience reminded me of the  fishing village in the film Howl's Moving Castle - the way the property appears on the outside from the street is completely different from the magical cottage in the garden Highly recommend ,5

16112,3884893,30128324,2015-04-18,23268619,Chuck,Overall a disappointment  This is a small apartment  Access to it is via a narrow stair with a railing so wobbly it had to be reinforced with moderate success by a bent iron rod loosely attached to the opposite wall  It's single file walking straight up with almost no room for luggage  Beyond the door is a small one room combo dining/kitchen area with three small bedrooms adjoining it  A dead plant and a few empty wine bottles in the window set the atmosphere  My small windowless bedroom had a private bath while the other two share a bath off the dining area  (You may encounter as I did the host's girlfriend dashing across the room clad only in a towel)  My bed came equipped with only a fitted sheet two pillows and a comforter giving it a sad flophouse/hostel feel  The flat sheet was found a few days later folded in another one of the rooms  When I asked the host about it he responded as though he didn't quite know how a bed should be made  The room itself was clean for the most part except for underneath the bed where there were socks assorted papers half an inch of dust and an unwrapped candy chew that had been there so long it had petrified  You should bring an extra roll or two of toilet tissue as the host provides little and keeps the extra stock in his locked bedroom  The room with the private bath also comes with an air purifying device which I suspect was placed there to mask the thumping latin music from the apartment next door  The throbbing bass invades the room most of the day eliminating any chance of crashing for an hour in the afternoon before going out for the night  Most nights I found it finally ended around  pm  The other sound issue occurs every single morning when the residents of all the floors above come thundering down the staircase on the other side of the bedroom wall  I confirmed this was an issue for guests using the other bedroom as well  Unfortunately the area around the apartment is a culinary desert  Had to walk several blocks down Lexington to find a decent burger  There is a small grocery around the corner  It's true that the # train is only a few yards away from the door of the apartment building making it relatively easy to escape to real food and a much better environment elsewhere in the city ,4
438197,12680171,101336025,2016-09-12,67344683,Loren,Rupi was very helpful in advance of my visit answering my questions about the area getting around etc She was mos accommodating of my travel plans with late arrival and handled the late arrival of my traveling companions plane that made me late for meeting her extremely well While she was headed out of town herself she provided me a nice tour of the house and contact info for a relative in the area if I had any needs or issues Truly a  star host that made my first airbnb experience wonderful,5

793439,4120954,40350780,2015-07-30,37011599,Isabelle,Everton est un hôte extrêmement accommodantNotre arrivée prévue tard dans la soirée a été acceptée sans problème et sans surcoût de même que notre départ en soirée Nous devions atterrir à h et pensions pouvoir être à l'appartement pas trop tard résultat après des heures d'attente pour passer les douanes et la police (ne partez jamais de façon à arriver la nuit l'effectif des contrôles est drastiquement réduit) un cauchemar Résultat nous sommes arrivés à l'appartement à h du matin Nous étions terriblement désolés pour Babou le collaborateur d'Everton qui nous attendait là basNous sommes restés en contact par sms tout le temps de sorte que le pauvre savait que l'attente allait être longue et la nuit courte (il travaillait le lendemain matin)Donc Babou merci encore mille fois pour ton accueil si chaleureux malgré l'heure tardive (et au fait merci pour le chapeau de Victor que tu as retrouvé dans le jardin )Babou s'est montré disponible répondant à nos textos très rapidement chaque fois que nous avions besoin de lui Il nous a également appelé un taxi pour le départ ce qui nous a bien arrangésEverton est un hôte très professionnel rien n'est laissé au hasard il nous a appelé à deux reprises pour nous demander si tout se passait bien et si rien ne nous manquait L'appartement se trouve à l'étage au dessus de la porte d'entrée ainsi qu'à l'étage supérieur (les deux derniers étages) On a l'impression d'être dans une maison plus que dans un appartementIl est réellement magnifique plein d'anciennes boiseries d'époque mais rénové avec tout le confort moderneLa cuisine est bien équipée et spacieuse  Au même niveau se trouve une chambre avec deux lits simples et une salle de bain avec douche et wc A l'étage deux chambres doubles avec leur salle de bain respectives bain et wc et une petite buanderie)Chaque chambre est très spacieuse avec grande penderie et climatisation Les lits sont confortables Les salles de bain modernesL'appartement est très propre et agréable avec une terrasse au niveau de la cuisineSeule manque une clim dans la pièce principale qui du coup est un peu chaude Mais ça ne nous a pas trop gênés Maintenant le quartier Nous en sommes tombés amoureux Notre fils de  ans rêve d'y vivre Les rues de maisons en briques sombres (brownstone) bordées de grands arbres avec des petits jardins fermés par des grilles en fer forgé Très loin de l'agitation de Manhattan Pas de grand buildingTout est propre L'environnement très agréable La population souriante et gaie Le samedi soir nous avons vécu une animation de quartier avec musique dans chaque rue barbecues entre voisins et feux d'artificeCe quartier est magique Il va me manquerMerci encore Babou et Everton pour votre accueil,1

325737,11371535,193956304,2017-09-15,34746952,Сергей,Спасибо Дональду за гостеприимство Мы были всего  дня в Нью Йорке и наш плотный график не позволил много пообщаться с хозяином а жаль Расположение жилья очень хорошее рядом есть всё для бюджетного путешественника питание супермаркеты магазины От метро идти всего пару минут Жильё находится в очень хорошем доме По району погулять не удалось всё время ушло на изучение Манхэттена и возвращались мы довольно поздно огромное спасибо Дональду за такую возможность Комната очень уютная уютная и мягкая кровать в комнате чисто много растений Дональд занимается аквариумами чем вызывает у меня восхищение я сам когда то этим занимался это огромный труд и ответственность а это характеризует Дональда как очень ответственного хозяина Если я когда нибудь поеду ещё раз в Нью-Йорк то хотел бы остановиться вновь у Дональда и уже больше с ним пообщаться надеюсь к этому времени я лучше выучу язык,5
353482,10163955,135853168,2017-03-06,116511,Valerie,The LES and East Village are our favorite parts of NYC and my husband and I were so lucky to use Grant's place as our home base during our trip The location is great the bed was super comfortable for the two of us and there was plenty of space in the apartment overall The second floor location was also a big plus since it was away from street level but not too many flights of stairs to climb We were warm and comfortable despite the  degree weather outsideThe amenities are pretty basic (for instance the towels are a bit old and there are just enough things in the kitchen to heat up some food but not enough to cook anything elaborate) but if you're like us you won't be spending much time in the apartment with so much to explore in NYC just steps away Great location and value we would certainly return,4

131882,6914459,77111122,2016-05-30,1809494,Megan,Ehtan was quick to respond to messages and the apartment was clean  Decent/nice kitchen and bathroom   In general however this is a very basic budget style Airbnb The fridge was dirty and unprepared for guests the coffee mugs were chipped or broken and we were provided with only a bath towel (no hand towels in the bathroom - not even shampoo) All the cleaning supplies are out (mop bucket and vacuum)  despite there being numerous closets in the apartment There are big bleach stains on the sheets which cover the mattress in the living room and the living room feels worn (but clean) I felt very awkward arriving at night and having to wait outside until someone else left the building so that I could get inside and get the keys to Ethan's apartment from the lockpad  Charging extra after the first person in a  bedroom apartment felt like being nickel and dimed  as did the  cleaning fee I live in Brooklyn and that is double what I pay to have my  bedroom apartment cleaned The master bedroom is quite nice and airy with a fan and there is AC in the smaller bedroom (which is basic at best and not pleasant) The living room is large and sunny but because there is no AC it can be very hot  In staying at Airbnb's over the years with many friends this was the first one that was actually disappointing Not only were the basics lacking but but there was none of the extra hospital touches most Airbnb hosts offer such as tea or coffee or a simple note about neighborhood spots ,4

393993,435946,13004070,2014-05-17,13750200,Anne Marie,"The apartment would be comfortable for a single person as it is a studio and the bed is pushed up against the wall so in our opinion it is really only suitable for one Yes the apartment did get the morning sun but we found it odd that the sleeping/living area did not have any ceiling lights Deia has provided several lamps but be aware that ""romantic"" means dimly lit once the sun setsThe wireless internet worked really well even when we had several devices running I couldn't work out the TV system though Not sure whether or not there was cable TV so we went without watching the news for a few daysWe didn't use the kitchen but there is a large fridge The laundry is handy as it's on the same floor and works well The common room and gym upstairs looked good however the roof terrace was being refurbished while we were there Also be aware that the exterior of the building is covered in scaffolding although this did not interfere with our stayIt does overlook a small park but that is across the  lane freeway and traffic is a constant The only time we had some quiet was when they closed the freeway for Obama I realise that this is New York but we've stayed in other places where noise was not a concern I think the issue could have been the windows but we weren't willing to touch it due to Deia's house rules My partner is a light sleeper so we had to shorten our stay Fortunately Deia was very accommodating and replied promptly even though she was not in the country at the time I couldn't fault her attentiveness and concern about our welfare",4

233818,886833,8684672,2013-11-12,7526846,Maria,Christina was a fabulous host  She went out of her way to pick my daughter and I up at the airport and dropped us off the day we left  She also provided lots of snacks towels and blankets (more than we needed)The apartment is just as described  It is much larger than a regular NYC hotel room The heating worked well and there are many locks on the doors although the area appears to be very safe Christina went out of her way to provide explicit directions on how to get places and even picked us up after we lost our way through the neighborhood  The train ride to Manhattan does take about  minutes but I believe the express train service was interpreted due to construction  When we are able to return to NYC I will be booking the room at Christina's place again,5

158691,10723838,69940064,2016-04-14,217472,Jonathan,The apartment is about a  minute walk to the subway which takes you into downtown Manhattan in another  minutes The area is residential with houses and a few housing projects  I found it safe at night There  are some inexpensive restaurants on the block which is very convenientThe rooms are on the second floor of a house that you enter with a code The room are a decent size some with two queen size beds and some with queen size bed and a couch Each room can sleep up to  people The room was a bit cold in April but should be OK in Spring and Summer In Winter and Fall it might be a problemThere are clean linens and towels and all the rooms lead into a common space with a kitchen and couch and two bathrooms each with a showerI don’t know why some of the guests complained about it being dirty A housekeeps comes in every morning and I found it very clean Perhaps there was a time that it wasn’t so well managedMajor plus is a super fast internet in the living room and a bit slower in the room but still quite fast There is a friendly cat that becomes to the owner that comes in and out of the apartment so if you are allergic to cats this airbnb may not be for youThis is not the hipster part of bushwick but it does have some hip coffee shops and some other signs of gentrification but it’s not yet a place to hang out  A  minute walk or five minute subway ride will take you into the hip Bushwick scene with its nightlife and art galleriesAll  and all a decent place to stay at a reasonable price - particularly if you are  or  to a room - if you don’t mind taking  minutes to get into Manhattan  Basically it’s a trade off of price versus convenience,5

522127,2707450,15585250,2014-07-12,16507661,Kai,What we enjoyed about our stay) The location is great and within walking distance to lots of places such as Empire State Building Time Square and Penn Station) There is lots of space in the apartment) The air conditioning on the main floor worked well and kept the main floor comfortable) There is a laundry room within the complexConcerns we had with our stay) On our last night  members of our family saw a mouse run from the kitchen to the living room and back) The bathroom is large but there isn't any counter space for placing toiletries) The  bed bedroom in the loft was roomy but as there was only a small fan which did not move (oscillate) it was fairly warm as nightOverall the location is very good Henry is friendlyWe would rate our stay as  stars,5

377229,7885338,144103773,2017-04-14,61045283,Christopher,My oversell stay was satisfactory The room was just as the photos described and other than the one issue in my room the place was very clean Lots of places to eat and enjoy in a walkable distance and very close to public transportation My only main issue is that the walls are very thin and the other residents weren't very conscious of their noise and volume especially in the late hours Also the residents directly above the room were also very loud into the late hours which kept me up way past an hour that I would have liked I used the personal ac and a noise machine on my phone to drown out the noises but both nights my sleep was interrupted So if you're in town for business and not pleasure I would just be aware of that possibility Other than that my stay was good ,5

Federica,Joseph è una persona veramente simpatica e cordiale con cui si è stabilita una immediata simpatia sin dai primi contatti via mail L'accoglienza è stata adeguata check-in e check-out hanno funzionato perfettamente L'appartamento/studio si trova in una ottima posizione in una zona centrale ma tranquilla e con ampia scelta di ristoranti e shopping center dove fare la spesa L'apt/studio è piuttosto luminoso forse non così ampio come sembrerebbe dalle foto Ideale per max - persone TV e Internet eccellenti La cucina è abbastanza comoda (soprattutto lavastoviglie e microonde) anche se molto essenziale nelle stoviglie (pentole/piatti/posate) È disponibile un ripostiglio per gli abiti ma in parte ingombro di materiale vario e non abbiamo riscontrato cassetti liberi L'unico punto dolente (di cui ho già informato Joseph) è l'aria condizionata (indispensabile nelle afose giornate estive) L'apparecchio infatti è efficiente solo parzialmente in quanto buona parte di esso è coperto dalla grande scrivania e anche il ventilatore in dotazione è troppo rumoroso per essere utilizzato nelle ore notturne Personalmente ho suggerito a Joseph una diversa disposizione dei mobili,1
